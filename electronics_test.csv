"I read the camera specs which is what caught my eye and they are great - takes great picture but the ""zoom"" feature quickly distorts actual picture.",neg
"I can do everything I need on this tablet while traveling - check my email, browse the internet with the silk browser app, youtube, free app games etc. Because I have an amazon prime account as well, I linked my tablet to it so I can access a huge variety of free music, tv and movies. There are several offline options to load files onto the SD card, or to your tablets memory, so you can watch movies or use it as a mp3 player while away from internet. I watched a 2 hour movie on the airplane and only went through 30% of the battery power. Beautiful screen, loud speakers with the option for headphones. I have no reason to want anything more expensive, such as an ipad or surface since this does all I need while away from home.",pos
"I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",neg
Wish it had its own onternet connection but other than that great purchase,pos
Bought 3 for different and after 3 years mine went kerplot gona get new upgraded one for Christmas this year,pos
Great item easy to use and setup fast and great for surfing the web yes I would recommend,pos
Use for entertainment only. It works GREAT. Best option for those that don't want to spend so much for an I Pad.,pos
nice tablet function well great item for surfing the Web easy to use and set up yes I would recommend,pos
"Easy to setup, easy to use. I've had another tablet, but it wasn't as easy and comfortable to use. For what I bought it for, it's perfect for me. It weighs less than a pound (compared to my other tablet), and I can read what's on the screen easier. Without a manual, the best thing you can do is play with it. I'm still learning this and expect to get rolling on it very soon.",pos
use it everyday. enjoy reading using the Kindle Fire HD 10.,pos
Easy to set up. Good size tablet. Like the addition of Alexa,pos
Great gift for my dad who cant get out in the yard anymore like he used to. He's not tech savvy but he got used to the kindle pretty quickly.,pos
"Got this for my nephew, he had a galaxy and loves the amazon",pos
My mother in law loves her kindle!! She plays her games on it and can use it without glasses!,pos
I would recommend this tablet because of the value,pos
"The Kindle10 is OK, but a bit confusing to figure out. I do love the larger screen since I need to increase the text size. However, I did find a book that does explain the Kindle10 version on Amazon.",pos
"I love the kindle. I'm not completely happy with the sound quality of the speaker's. And, a month later it already seems to be lagging and freezing a bit. I have one music app, several books, and a few games on it. I don't seem to be using it as much as my 7 during long trips just because of the size.",pos
"The kindle fire 10 is a major upgrade from the original fire. My kids, 8 and 11, referred to it as an IPad when it was first received.",pos
"As I age, it's difficult for me to see the smaller screens so when this one came out .... I was delighted!!! Love playing my games!!!",pos
"This tablet is so much easier to use than my 6"" fire. It is great for reading or eatching movies.",pos
"I was looking for a larger tablet than my 7"" Kindle Fire and was on the fence that the 10"" Kindle Fire would be too large. Much to my surprise, it has been an easy adjustment. While larger, the video viewing is better and the magazine reading is much easier on the eyes. Although I miss my 7"" for my book reading as the 10"" seems too big, I am happy overall with the new tablet.",pos
"I like Kindle obviously but I find the 10 inch is bulky, heavier and difficult to handle by someone with carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis. It's easier to see the screen on the 10"" but I prefer the smaller screen because it's better for handling with my arthritic, weak joints/grip. I do have to admit the bigger screen is better for watching videos and movies!",pos
I love my original Kindle Fire but the size and features on the latest Kindle are a plus,pos
Easy to use and the large screen has wonderfully clear picture.,pos
"Best Kindle yet, better resolution faster processor, very flexible use",pos
"We have had several of the Kindles over the years. This was a replacement to an HDX (wish they still made those). The screen is big and very clear and easy to navigate. Kids play alot of games and use it to read books on for school. I would also recommend these to family members, like grandparents. The screen size and ease of use makes for less calls back to the family IT person.",pos
I bought this Tablet for my Wife. She uses it every day. It is very usefulto her. She uses it in place of a computer. She watches movies on it.The Graphics are excellent.,pos
"I bought this for a family member because they had the smaller 7"" Amazon Fire. The 10"" version can be held easier in my opinion",pos
"I find the picture quality amazing, the size over earlier model is welcome. Also, battery lasts many hours. For the price, it is a real bargain.",pos
Excellent product. I Upgraded to the Fire HD 10 10.1,pos
I bought this for my wife who is an avid reader and she loves it more than her last one.,pos
upgraded from a previous model and cannot be happier,pos
Love this product works great so far i would recommend this to others,pos
Biggest and best Kindle yet. Light as a feather. Buy one today.,pos
This is my first kindle and I have been very pleased with it for what I payed for it.,pos
"Perfect technology for my 11 year old son for games, reading, and homework.",pos
This tablet does everything that we need it to do. The screen looks really good and it doesn't seem to be under powered. The expandable storage feature is awesome if you want to store music and movies on it. The only thing that is a negative is the limited selection of apps for it. I knew about it before I bought it and it hasn't been an issue yet.,pos
"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need? My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .",pos
Purchased as a gift and the owner loves the functionality and size of the tablet.,pos
I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves this Kindle. It is a good size and the price was right.,pos
Love my new Kindle Fire HD 10. I travel with it as well as use it at home. Perfect size for my needs. I own a 8in. but fount it was too small. Just ordered a keyboard to take when traveling.,pos
"you might find it somewhat short on available apps. My wife has an Android (Samsung) that is quite deep in app selection. That is not to say you can't find suitable choices. Every machine has it's qwerks and the Kindle starts up when you plug it in to charge. Unnecessary. Overall the 10"" is great viewing, especially for the older eyes.",pos
This is a wonderful tablet. It's lite weight and super simple to use. I bought one for myself and thinking of getting one for my grandmother.,pos
Wonderful product! I really enjoy the big screen. Highly recommend this product for anyone wanting a good video viewing experience or utilizing Kindle Books with large format pages.,pos
The display is so much better than my previous Kindle Fire and have found more uses for it. It's nice to pull up my Comcast app and watch shows while working out on the treadmill. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Alexa was loaded as well!,pos
"I bought this tablet for my wife. She likes the size for reading books and for reading info on the web. The tablet's size is a little big for just holding it and for carrying it around. It also has to be charged often, and that's not even considering time reading books. Hard to find a case for this latest kindle.",pos
"great screen, a little slow at times and screen touch could be better.",pos
I was initially going to just get the Amazon Kindle but I thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books. I buy e-college texts. It has helped me so much!! I'm so happy I invested my money in this.,pos
Easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price,pos
The store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with Best Buy Program membership.,pos
"I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad, but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad.",pos
can't say enough about this works awesome great price,pos
Although not the greatest tablets on the market when compared to Apple or Samsung products but when you weight in the price it is worth the purchase!,pos
Picked up my fire hd 10 from the store on Saturday. it took most of the day to update the software. You would think that he software would just update to the current software . even that was not a big deal. after that I had some issues with the battery so what I did was bring it back to a factory reset. what that did was keep the software build and battery life was better. I have not had any issues with the appstore and I also sideload apps that aren't available to the amzon appstore. all in all this tablet has been great for me. my other tablet was kindle hd 8.9 and it has service my good for the last 4 yrs,pos
I have enjoyed my Kindle. I am a hoping they can upgrade the resolution in the future.I love the bigger screen as my vision is impaired. Definitely a keeper as I love reading.,pos
Bought for my wife and she loves it. Screen size is a huge plus. Easy to use I.,pos
I bought this device for my wife. She has been using a Kindle Fire 7.I wanted something with a bigger screen for her.She likes it very much.,pos
"My wife owns one, so we bought one for my mom who is not tech-savvy, and she seems to be having great success with it so far. Had to buy a case separately because for some reason Best Buy doesn't have any avail in store or even on-line, but the Fire itself is great for light users.",pos
I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! You can't beat it for the price!,pos
These were gifts for my grown children for Christmas. They were extremely pleased and loved them. Haven't had their laptops out since receiving these tablets. Very convenient and easy to use.,pos
"This was an upgrade from my Amazon 7 inch. Bigger screen was the key for me. It's great for listening to music, reading books, watching movies, tv sports, tv shows and playing all the games. Hours of relaxation and entertainment along with Amazon ' s new Alexa.",pos
Bought it as a gift for my mom she loves it and uses it all the time,pos
I bought this for my husband for a Christmas gift. He absolutely loves it.He reads lots of books and does some web surfing. I am very pleased with this purchase.,pos
Love the larger screen and picture clarity. It is very easy to use.,pos
My wife really enjoys the amazon fire. Has very good picture quality. Very easy to figure out how to use because its similar to our smart phone.,pos
"very happy. tablet or smart tv for bedroom. movies,news,games and web browsing. great picture and good sound. best product for price.",pos
"I got the amazon Fire HD 10 for reading and other activities. It was very easy to set up. Netflix worked ok on it. It mostly works well, but there are limitations to the apps that are available. I tried it out for a while and then returned it for a Samsung S2 9.7.",pos
Even though the ppi is lower than the other tablets I didn't really notice it. I like the letterbox format which allows the use of more of the screen area when viewing movies and TV.,pos
"I'm so glad I purchased this! I did have the older version with the smaller screen and what a difference it makes having the larger screen! It's volume & clarity are great, it's light and easy to use. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is on the fence and thinking about purchasing it.",pos
This product makes it easier to pay my bills online and search for things to buy,pos
"An amazing electronic tool, so portable, great storage, books, great convenience.",pos
This Kindle is alot larger and better for viewing.,pos
"Love my new kindle, thought the screen would be too large but after using it a few days, all is good. Very thin , got a case for it, I now feel at home with it. Do not like the ""new"" lock screen lock to open the tablet at all, its tiny and hard to ""unlock"" most always taking several times to swipe it just right.",pos
"Received a Kindle Fire as a gift about 10 years ago. Finally went to Kindle heaven. Bought myself a new Kindle Fire HD 10, Geek Squad in store helped me set it up and transfer all my information from old one to new one. I love it and the service was awesome.",pos
Want a port for addition memory this model had it!,pos
Love the apps of this device. Many hours of enjoyment for my son. Nice size for him to watch videos and learn as well.,pos
bought for my wife for her birthday and she loves it,pos
Easy-to-use experience and the things I've able to do over my old kindle,pos
My husband is up in years & really enjoys spending time on his Kindle. He had a smaller one & it gave out on him so this one is ideal. He spends hours on it & has hours of fun!!!,pos
"Can't live without this, use for email, banking, social media, reading, watching movies, tv shows, online college courses. Even prints to wireless printer.",pos
"big screen,2 year old granddaughter watches Sesame Street and scrolls through selections....",pos
Nice size works fine needs to weigh a little less.,pos
"I JUST luv my Fire HD Tablet,love playing my games on it,so easy to carry around",pos
"The Fire 10 will do anything that the I Pad will do, and is at a much more attractive price.",pos
"I had the smaller version of this & was looking to get rid of it & my google nexus. This is just what I wanted, it uses my Amazon prime account & takes a memory card so I can load it with all my videos I watch while at the gym.",pos
I enjoy this tablet is very easy to use. The only issue that I do have about this tablet is it does not come pre-loaded with Google. I just had to go to YouTube to find a video on how to install Google onto this device.,pos
This is my 3rd Kindle. I have continued to move up on the screen size and this one is so easy to see and read. I do however sometimes have a problem with it when I am online. It can take forever to load up a site and move from page to page so that can be annoying. I have extremely fast internet so that is not the problem and when I check strength of wifi connection it always says excellent so not sure why it takes so long. Do not have that problem on my other 2.,neg
It has everything I need and the size makes it easy to read.,pos
I did some research on different types of tablets and this one had what I needed,pos
Excellent tablet both for reading books and for going to the web,pos
Nice size and very nice video quality. Finger swiping much more effective than using a stylus.,pos
"Great size, easy to use and it has a sleek look that is attractive.",pos
"The Amazon fire HD10 is one of the best deals on the market. I've had a IPad and would rather have the HD10! It's what-1/3 of the price of a IPad and just as good, if not better",pos
"I have been a kindle owner since they first came out. This version has many,many more bells and whistles but I still use mine mostly for books, audible books and a place for me to download music I can listen to when I travel. Sometimes it is a bit slow opening up different apps and functions but overall it is functional, dependable and useful to me",pos
"I love this Kindle 10, it is large enough to see very easily and very easy to handle when traveling. I love the size of it.",pos
Crystal clear screen. Easy to use. Reading for day/night excellent!,pos
"Love the tablet, not only for reading (upgrade from Kindle) but for searching the Internet, email, etc. And I can take it anywhere. Cheaper than an iPAD and does enough for what I need.",pos
Kindle products are easy to use and set up. It does most everything the expensive tablets do.,pos

Nice phone for the price. Would recommend if on a budget.,pos
I absolutely love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. My kids and I can't put it down!,pos
"I love the 2 cameras, and the video capabilities. I have set up the picture albums and can even share on Facebook and messenger. I like the side charger. Much better than front.I love the size too.",pos
"I use my Kindle fire HD 10 in 3 ways 1 for reading Kindle books, 2 for streaming TV shows or movies while riding my exercise bike, 3 to surf the internet.",pos
"Love my kindle fire, takes awesome pictures and its convenient for on the go.",pos
"I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase.",pos
"I LOVE MY KINDLE! I surf the web, take pictures and play games on it. I use it everyday.",pos
This was a great purchase met needs of 93 old mom in law who needed a large read space for bad eyes,pos
Got this for my dad as a gift. He loved it! Great alternative to an iPad,pos
I absolutely love my new kindle tablet!! I love the size and feel of it. It has auto blue shade. I can set it for what time I want it to dim.,pos
Bought this tablet for my 84 year old grandpa and he loves it. Easy to use,pos
I like the bigger screen size. It allows me to read my books without straining my eyes and allows more of the text to be displayed.,pos
"I think the kindle is the best value for the money, this is my third. Each model gets better than the last, I'm loving my 10.1. Comfortable to use does everything I need and beautiful video.",pos
Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most.,pos
I love this product it is so easy to use It has a clear picture,pos
Bought this for someone as a gift and htey love it.,pos
"I had a 7 inch kindle hd tablet. I wanted a larger screen so I purchased the 10 inch kindle. I am very happy with the device. I surf the web, play some games, read books, and process my email.",pos
"Bought this a month ago. Well worth the money. Excellent size and quality of use. This is my second Amazon tablet. Bought one for my Grandson. Loved his. Decided to buy another. You also access Alexa from this tablet. Only one problem, battery doesn't last as long as it could on a full charge. The large screen makes it great for watching movies on Amazon Prime.",pos
Great table does everything that i need it for. Great resolution and screen for reading books,pos
Very nice. Easy to use. Got it to use with Amazon prime. Great combo.,pos
"I love it!! It can do it all!! Beautiful color graphics and in no time at all, I can watch a movie or play games or read my favorite novel. I love it!!",pos
Very happy with my purchase!! I bought this for my Mom and it was easy for her to navigate and she was able to easily download books and games.,pos
"The Amazon Fire tablets are nice tablets. They're especially great for streaming tv and movies. And since it's a Kindle it's great for books too. It is a little odd with the Internet browser, and still a little limited in the app store. But overall a great little tablet.",pos
AFTER 3 YEARS WITH A SMALLER AMAZON FIRE THIS ITEM IS A GREAT RELACEMENT. VERY SLEEK DESIGN. OVERALL EASE TO UPDATE FROM ORIGINAL SOFTWARE WAS NICE . VERY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT,pos
I love my new Kindle. It is bigger than the last Kindle I had. This Kindle is much easier to handle and to read.,pos
Great notepad! Huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use. Love it!,pos
Expected it to be a bigger version of the HDX but it was not. The email was bad and so was the calendar.,neg
"Very large, pretty quick processing, great picture",pos
I love this device! Perfect size for my bad eyesight! Lol! I use it all the time! One down side is the .battery life is not great!,pos
This is what I have been waiting for. This HD10 Kindle is Super!,pos
"I had originally decided to get a kindle instead of an iPad due to the cost. It's a great screen and has good sound, but the battery is pure junk! I should have went with an iPad.",neg
My old tablet died..needed a new fast. This one was alot better than my old one. Clear screen videos look amazing..Sound is better than expected..It was in stock too. Overall very happy item and buying experience!,pos
I was using a Kindle Fire HD 7--love this new one!!,pos
"Purchased a new kindle because my original was very out of date. Has more memory, larger screen and does not freeze up. Love it.",pos
I love my new kindle. It is everything that I want. My only concern was that the store didn't carry the right case or the screen protector.,pos
Nice tablet and very fast/capable. The storage options are way better than the previous models. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone in the market for one.,pos
"Bought this tablet a month or so ago and waited to see see how I'd like it. My husband has owned a Zoom and I've owned 2-8 inch Samsungs...this by far is my favorite. (we bought one for him the same time and he loves his too). I use it for email, games, social media, internet and some accounting. I love it. It's fast, reliable, easy to use, easy to see. It seems durable but for extra protection, I bought a shock case with a flip stand on the back so it can be protected and more versatile. My only wish would be that its battery lasted longer for my constant use...but I suppose everyone needs a break every few (2-4) hours. It does charge back up pretty fast.I think its a great tablet!",pos
This was bought as a gift for my wife. She loves it very much. She uses it every day and it helps her relax. I am so happy that we found something she enjoys so much. It's screen is a good size and doesn't hurt one's eyes. It is easy to flow through the apps on the tablet. Thanks...,pos
This is a great tablet. If you are upgrading like I did all your games can be moved over.,pos
the first one I got was very slow. I turned it in today and this one works great,pos
"My first tablet. OUTSTANDING for NETFLIX, email, etc.",pos
The only reason I chose 1 star is because of size. The length is disproportionate to the width. Awkward when holding it.,neg
My sister told me about the Kindle Fire and I wanted one so she said she bought hers from Best Buy.,pos
Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. Would have given it 5 stars but it hasn't changed enough from the last Kindle that I purchased several years ago.,pos
"I sometimes find the store a little intimidating, and certainly overwhelming. I don't always know what I want beforehand. My existing Surface failed in far to short a time frame, and since I really only used it to read I was able to replace its functions with a kindle fire, and I am actually much happier with it.",pos
New fire has a number of changes over my Kindle fire some easier to use others not so. Overall a very good product t.,pos
I've had my kindle fire 7.0 for more than 3 years. it works great but I wanted a bigger screen. I love it.,pos
"Over the past few years, I have purchased Kindle Fires for various family members. The workmanship for those Kindles in abysmal. Two weeks ago, my Kindle Fire HDX shorted itself out. I replaced it with Amazon Fire 10.1. This device does NOT hold a charge for more than three and a half hours. You read that correctly!. I have been using it on a daily basis, each time it needs to be charged, it does a repeat performance. There is absolutely NO way that I will ever purchase any device manufactured by Amazon, ever again. I tell it like it is, if you want terrible device performance, opt for the Amazon product. If you need a reliable device, look at other manufacturers for the options you need.",neg
"This tablet is certainly large which makes it cumbersome when reading in a reclining position. However, its terrific for reading or watching films on a plane, desk or otherwise sitting up.",pos
Love the bigger screen but do think this Fire HD 10TH runs a little slow. My last Fire HD was not as slow.,pos
"This Kindle in the largest,thinnest yetfastestand most durable. We purchase the geek squad insurance with it kindly. Best decision ever.",pos
"I love the new Kindle fire 10"" HD. I love the large screen to watch movies on.",pos
The fire was a good size. Good image easy to setup. It was what I wanted. Ads popup every time you start it but not a big deal to ignore them,pos
Large display makes it easy to use. Very easy to use.,pos
"I enjoyed the way the Fire 10 transfered all of my books, games and apps. It only took a little bit of time to go through the start up. The Fire starts up quick and I love the larger screen for reading my books. The colors are brilliant.",pos
"The tablet is fast, clear, and easy to use. Highly recommended!",pos
"The Amazon tablet series has come along way since it first came out. The screen on the Fire HD 10 is stunning. Clear and easy to read. If used to android apps though, may be disappointed that some of your favorite apps will not be available on this tablet.",pos
Got this as a replacement for an iPad 9.7 pro. Much more flexible as to third party add ons . And after having both prefer the size of the Fire hd10.1,pos
Got this laptop for an in-bound college student. Best option that I found.,pos
Just writing this review to get my points...This was a gift for my mother. I think she likes it fine.,pos
"Gift for my wife, she loves it. Reads on it all the time.",pos
Very easy to set up and easy to use. Touch screen response is great. This is my first tablet and I am very pleased. There are lots of available Apps.,pos
"I thought the tablet would be a little wider, its just too long",neg
NEW LARGER SCREENIS GREAT FOR WATCHING PRIME MOVIES AND READING BOOKS,pos
"I got this for my mom to use as her ""computer"" and I am so happy with it. It's ease of use and ability to store pics for my mom is a big plus. Thanks !!!!",pos
Great tablet! New to me so I have a lot to learn about it's functions.,pos
Nice to read books and play games only down side is battery only holds charge for 8 hours unlike the smaller ones that last longer,pos
"A present for my wife, she says she really enjoys the larger screen.",pos
I don't care for having to close each window separately I would prefer to be able to select close all or exit all,pos
"good,like the larger size screen and able to increase font for easy reading",pos
"Since I wasn't familiar with tablets, I had a little trouble navigating it, but the help section was a BIG help to me, as well as your staff. The tablet is doing exacting what I wanted and needed it for. I like the case that I bought to go with it.",pos
"I've really enjoyed using the Kindle Fire 10 (16gb). It's perfect for watching movies and tv shows. The only problem is the storage. Other than that, I highly recommend it.",pos
"Got this Kindle Fire to replace a laptop that died. So far I have been very pleased. Finding new things that it can do. Not happy with the camera, but I might not know all the details about it yet.",pos
"Great tablet, great resolution, very light and fast speed.",pos
"I wasn't offer the warranty, but I enjoy it a lot.",pos
The size and clarity of this fire tablet is very nice,pos
"Love how user friendly the Kindle Fire is, for any age..",pos
"Improvements over earlier 10"" kindles. Only need a case or stand .",pos
"Liked it a lot,, Liked it a lot, liked it a lot!!!",pos
"I had an old ipad and when it quit I decided to go for the amazon fire tablet--really only used it to play games and for entertainment....i hate it---battery life is very short I pretty much need to keep it plugged in at all times, and it freezes and just shuts out of screens. I can't take it anymore and am now going to buy another ipad---don't waste your money on this!! I am very unimpressed with this product and amazon in general now.",neg
Very satisfied. Use it daily while watching TV and other activites,pos
"I love the kindle and have had one in one shape or another since they first came out, but I just could not take how slow this model was. I returned it and purchased a Samsung tablet.",neg
No problems the unit work as Apple has explained with little or no effort,pos
"Bought an IPad and didn't like it. Returned it and got the Fire 10.1. This is my third Fire, love it....no.learning curve.",pos
"I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin, you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product.",pos
"Bought for a gift for my girlfriend, she loves it she had the little 7"" fire this is like holding a flat screen very nice picture.",pos
"I have been a kindle fan for years because it does so much more if you have Amazon prime. Free movies, free music, free books, etc. The tablet has a great picture, is fast to search, and lasts for years.",pos
I recently bought my fourth Kindle. I bought it because it is familiar and while there are improvements the keyboard is still difficult and not accurate. I also do not like the auto correct especially when writing a document. Browsing is quite good but I am a AOL user and Kindle makes it difficult to use. I definitely would like to see some improvement with making it easier to print.,pos
I recommend this product to anyone who loves to read...great great great,pos
I love my new Kindle. Previously had the Fire HDX 8.9 and upgraded to this one. I love love it and still discovering new things it can do. Very much recommend all purchase this,pos
"Works great for my grandson - had the Geek squad get a security plan setup on it and him acquainted with it. Battery life not great, but with a bright 10 inch screen on a THIN tablet is not surprising.",pos
This Fire 10 is so much better than my old Kindle Fire HD that I now wonder why I waited so long to upgrade. The 10' display is awesome and the speed is very good. All the Amazon apps from my old Kindle were immediately loaded onto my new one and adding the others through the Kindle app store was quick and easy.,pos
I have had at least three Amazon Fires and have been very happy with each one.,pos
Like the large screen for reading books and watching movies.,pos
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that I can see a whole page at one time. The protective cover that Best Buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the On/Off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that I had to find another cover from another source.,pos
Purchased the Amazon Fire HD 10 16GB for my mother and mother in law for Christmas. They LOVE their Kindle and the large screen is very easy on their aging eyes.,pos
"Excellent value priced 10"" tablet. To bad Amazon killed it. I purchased it as a gift for my wife and she loves the size and quality of the display.",pos
"This tablet was SO easy to set up, even this old technologically-challenged grandma did it without help! I am able to load many books on it. It is convenient and easy to handle.",pos
"Easy to navigate, love the features! Just wish the price was lower!",pos
I bought this for my dad. It is easy for him to use and he loves it because you dont have to be super tech wise to operate it.,pos
"I love it! If I ever get to where I can use even half of its features I'll be satisfied. I bought it because my wife reads all the time, and wanted something that would read to her. We didn't even know about the Movies and other things that are available. The Camera is so nice! All of this and ALEXI too! GREAT!!! Bob Jones...",pos
For books games and internet it's perfectSound is a ittle weak,pos
Tablet is easy to work with only can be slow to come up on certain sites,pos
"I do not find this as easy to use as my original Kindle Fire but I do like the camera a lot better, though it is not clear megapixels",neg
"Upgraded from a 7"" to 10"" Kindle Fire and it is so worth it. Great picture. Good storage. Love my Kindle.",pos
I love this kindle. Everything is so much bigger and good for road trips,pos
"I had reviewed and looked at this Samsung 65"" 4k HDTV and at this timeit was the best for the money..Very satisfied with TV and would recommend it to anyone.",pos
Employees were very helpful. I always enjoy shopping at Best Buy.,pos
I go this tablet after problems with 2 Samsung tablets. so far like it. all apps I use available. A little slower than previous tablets that is the only reason for the 4 stars,pos
Love the silver color and larger screen also easy to navigate,pos
I upgraded from a kindle HDX 7 to this HD 10. I am pleased with it so far. The HDX will be hard to replace. I had it for 4 years and loved it. The 10 is a little bit slower but I have more time than money. The cameras and WiFi have been upgraded. Overall pleased with my purchase.,pos
"Amazing flexibility and range of available apps (over 2,000!) for this product. My daughter loves it!!",pos
It is great for a bigger picture but runs really slow.,neg
Love my kindle. Good idea to save some space around the house . The size is great for my bad eyes .,pos
"Love the capabilities it has to offer.Downside, it totally shuts off by itself and you have to start what you doing all over again",neg
This is a great tablet for the money. The only thing I would like to see is a longer battery life. Otherwise it's perfect,pos
"very good product. Exactly what I wanted, and a very good price",pos
"amazon won't let us download Plants vs Zombies.otherwise, it's terrific.",pos
I really like the auto on off feature. Volume control could be more ergonomic.,pos
I love my new Kindle!! I would recommend this to everyone!! It has so many features and love the size!!,pos
I love it!! I would buy this again! Not enuf space,pos
"I've had the first kindle fire, I love the tablet.Why because it's bigger",pos
"Excellent product for the price. Larger screen , light weight. Easy to download apps",pos
"Got this for my ""non-techy"" husband and he now uses it daily. Easy to learn to use. Harder to figure out how to print.",pos
I really like the bigger screen the only downside is it takes a lot of power so the battery wears out faster than the smaller kindle,pos
I hate this product,neg
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done",neg
many problems,neg
Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.,neg

"I had a tough time finding reviews for this version of the Tamron. Read several reviews comparing the Nikon and the Sigma equivalents to this lens' previous version. The main draw back for the original Tamron 600mm was some design issues like lack of weather proofing. All those seem to be addressed from what I can see and have read. I have not done a high end performance test with color charts dissecting every bit of pixel like some articles I read. I can say that it works very well and the detail I get with my D810 is incredible. I took the below shot at the zoo. The weight can be off putting to some people but that comes with the territory of any large lens and I don't see this one being anything out of the ordinary when it comes to weight. If you are like me and have been eyeing this lens for a while and over researching, do yourself a favor and just go out and get it. You wont be disappointed.",pos

"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need?  My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .",pos

"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well.",neg
"Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort.",pos
"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!",pos

"I love this product , so nice to have for trips!!!",pos
Good product works amazing . Works awesome from home .,pos
"Anyone needing a compact and easily mobile speaker should look at this. The sound quality is excellent, it is easy to sync via Bluetooth and gives you the ability to stream music when connected to wifi. Great product for the price and perfect for the office.",pos
Cute speaker. a bit expensive but the amazon streaming capabilities make it worth it,pos
Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality,pos
"Love the Tap, plays my daughter' s music. Works well if you are a Amazon Prime member.",pos
This product works great with my amazon account and best part is it does not listen too all my conversations. While it is an option I prefer to hit the button for it to recognize a voice command. That way its not listening till I tell it to unlike Google's device and the other amazon devices.,pos
Really like the Wi Fi & being able to take it to any room in the house. My music sounds great. Love all the features.,pos
"Overall for an Alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones. This one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging. The one main issue is that it is not voice activated (meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front. By having this feature, I could see it causing excess battery usage. Needs to be able to apps better.",neg
I first boughy alezxa from amazon and found the voice recognition and search algorithms lacking,pos
This is the echo you can take anywhere. Runs on battery and can connect via bluetooth when away from wifi.,pos
Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone.,pos
"Overall I was a little skeptical because this wasn't the product I wanted. Turns out, it's amazing!",pos
"I wanted a speaker to listen to Pandora and go so much more! Being able to speak to Alexa and get news, weather, timer, light controls and so much more! Love the product!",pos
"I have the Amazon dot, which is great. But after purchasing the tap, which was on sale too, I was sold. You can take it any where. And the sound is great!!!",pos
"We have had the full-size Echo for over a year, and I love it. The Tap requires you to push the button before Alexa responds to your requests, so that takes a little getting used to after using the big Echo's voice activated requests. The Tap speaker is not as good as the big Echo, but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge. Overall, I really like this...and I found it at best buy for $78!",pos
This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it.,pos
Great value and quality speaker that also connects to the information highway.,pos
"Unlike the larger version, this does not need to be plugged in..making it portable....although you have to press the button for every request..it's great to take with you where ever you go..fully rechargable",pos
We really love our new Amazon Tap. My Son enjoys playing with it.,pos
"So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem. Only catch is that you cannot stream a single Spotify account on more than one device at the same time, so if you find yourself purchasing the Dot or Echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time.",pos
"The Amazon Tap is outstanding. There have been more applications slowly becoming avaliable. It is simple to use. It works with our Nest, which is a nice application.",pos
"The Tap works great, just like Alexa's little helper.",pos
We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.,pos
The Amazon Tap is a great addition to my Smarthome system. We particularly like that we can move it from room to room without AC attached & the battery lasts a long time. We even take it outside to listen to music from Amazon Prime and Spotify. We recommend it highly.,pos
Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun,pos
Use is all the time. Backyard favorite. Great by the fire.,pos
"It takes me a few tries to figure out how to connect to internet and then change it to blue tooth when needed. Overall , once it's set up it's super easy to use. Works best if you have Spotify premium. Voice recognition is good and it improves over time. Sound quality is good. Battery is really good.",pos
"Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time.",pos
"I'm glad that I bought this product, it's easy to understand, my grandkids loves it.",pos
The Tap is a great companion to your every day business. It has become my partner in my daily communications.,pos
"Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!",pos
Good price works great would buy again good value for the price,pos
"I had trouble linking to my Joule Cooking App, finally got on the third day. I Love it now, still is learning Voice Recognition though",pos
"I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!",pos
"If you dont need the voice activation of Alexa, or want a smaller footprint and something that you can take with you, consider the Tap. Almost all of the functionality of Alexa, but in a smaller ( and less expensive ) version.Great room filling sound with out the distortion from some of the cheaper alternatives.",pos
Great sound quality from such a small item. Easy to hide so it's not noticeable.,pos
"This little speaker is way better that her mother. after that update making it hand free, i recommend to anyone.",pos
Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.,pos
This portable Bluetooth speaker has an excellent sound which can be taken anywhere unlike the Echo and Echo Dot which both have to be plugged in. Want to listen to a favorite song? Just ask Alexa. Want to know the weather report? Just ask Alexa. Want to know your horoscope? Just ask Alexa. A lot of fun and entertainment at a great price. Big things come in small packages!,pos
Can charge and take anywhere in the house! Holds a long charge.,pos
The product it amazing love that it turns in lights on and plays my favorite music.,pos
"I love it hut I think I should have got the bigger one, but its entertaining",pos
This Amazon tap is awesome! Take Alexa outside! The sound quality is amazing and the price is right!,pos
"Nice sound for the money, good highs not much lows",pos
Incredible range. Clear sound. We bought the sleeve and hung it in the backyard for a party. Amazing 360 clear sound.,pos
"This is a great device, with Alexa, and the battery makes it really portable. It follows me all over the house, on the deck, in the garage, etc.",pos
I have the have the Echo and this portable speaker is a great addition to my automated home. Especially if I'm working in the garage and want to listen to music,pos
Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. Great music player with all the great Alexa capabilities. Opted for the Tap because I'm a bit weary of the Echo always listening.,pos
"would get another, works great, having fun with all the options",pos
I like the portability of the tap and the sound is nice. You can set it up to either push the microphone button to activate it or you can set it up like the echo where you just say Alexa.,pos

Works as well as the Echo and now has a skill that can enable it to be voice activated rather than having to tap it. Battery charge lasts a long time and sound quality is good. Easy to move around in and out of the house. Will work anywhere you have WIFI. If you have the tap you may not have a need to invest in the more expensive Echo.,pos
"Purchased this as a gift for a teenage kid as a graduation present. Very pleased with the purchase. The kids love it. Small size, but good speakers. Perfect for the college dorms where he is scheduled to go in a couple of months. Love how the device connects to the cloud and keeps itself updated.",pos
I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.,pos
"If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem.",pos
Very easy to setup and use. Still learning to maximize the usage. The instructio is too simple and not cover much using Alexa .,pos
"The latest software update included hands free mode. So this can do everything that the stationary Echo speaker does, but is fully portable. Personally, I don't want the device to record everything I say all the time, so I only use the tap mode. The sound quality is good for a speaker of this size. This is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data. You can now bring Alexa on the go.",pos
"Alexa do ........something? Welcome to the new interconnected world Circlers! Do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice command? This may be for you! Do you feel that technology is driving our lives more and more toward the dystopia of David Eggers ""The Circle"" and you want to escape from technology for a while? Then likely not, as even though you have to touch the button on this unit as opposed to the always on Echo and Echo Dots, your life is still connected to Alexa via voice prompts! I liked using it for Amazon music, and the occasional Amazon Video, but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an Uber. Some people may feel they need technology to run their lives, I am not quite there yet and may never be! It is fun for what it does though, and it is a good bluetooth speaker!",pos
Having fun exploring the capabilities. The sound quality is great!,pos
"I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button.",neg
just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.,neg
"This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!",pos
"The tap has pretty good sound for a speaker this size. I also have an Amazon Dot, but would recommend you pay the extra cost and get the Tap to enjoy the better sound. It's worth it.",pos
"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",pos
I Luke it a lot and good to for it for and good to,pos
The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music,pos
"The Amazon Tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device. A few things to note if you're not familiar with the Tap or haven't seen it in person:- It's roughly the size of a glass of water- By default, you do have to press the microphone button to talk to Alexa, but as of an update released on Feb 17th, 2017 there is an option in the Alexa app to make the Tap always listen without pushing the button (at the expense of battery life)- The speaker grille is not metal, though it looks like it in pictures. It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker.",pos
"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it",neg
"I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!",pos
Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.,pos
When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,neg
I am enjoying the Tap very much. Lot's to do and play with on the app. Still finding new things it can do daily. Great sound quality to play my music. I only wish that it had a better search engine.,pos
I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.,pos
"I have the echo, the dot and now the tap. The sound is good. Better than the dot but not as good as the echo. The thing the tap has over the echo and dot is its portability. Which is nice not have to be next to a plug all the time. I would recommend it.",pos
Didn't want to spend $200 on the Echo for someone who's not use to using a Bluetooth speaker. Great buy and functions well.,pos
Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment,pos
"My family and I are enjoying Alexa. Great for playing music, setting timers, adding to shopping list, etc. Still finding new and useful things to do with it.",pos
My 8 yr old daughter loves her Tap. She uses it for HW and play. Never a dual moment when she is learning something new from her Tap.,pos
It is a quality product and has clear crisp sound. Best part it can be carried in any satchel. Sound is loud enough for a back yard gathering.,pos
"The Tap is a fun way to be able to bring Alexa around your home. Where ever you are, you can get access to all of the information, music, news, radio and more!",pos
Great sound. Love it. It's value is well worth it.,pos
We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.,neg
I purchased this for my son's birthday.. he loved it..,pos
"I use it all around the house. I move it upstairs and down. With the upgrade firmware you don't have to tap. Just say ""Alexa."" Good sound, but not as good as JBL charge speaker. I bought a 2nd one as a Christmas gift.",pos
"This is a fantastic little speaker with the power of Amazon Alexa. I use it to stream Spotify, Pandora andESPN Radio. Small speaker fills the Garage like a concert hall. Battery last 8 hrs and the charging stand could not be simpler to use.",pos
Love all the features that come with this speaker. Alexa function by tapping device is a nice change of pace from the always listening echo and dot! Above avarage sound on the go and got a great deal on it!,pos
We love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly.,pos
I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.,pos
Very happy with the Tap. We have the Echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck. With the Tap we just take it off the charging stand and go. No more bothering with Bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the Internet with TAP.,pos
"Great item, good service from Best Buy. It is uncanny that new and unique products are introduced often.",pos
I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It's amazing,pos
"Love the Tap! Bought it as a gift and love the sound quality. For such a small speaker, it packs a big punch!",pos
"This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically ""tap"" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo.",pos
I have owned the Echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides. Although the Tap doesn't have the hands free feature of the Echo I like its portability. I'm able to take it outdoors at home and using the WiFi play music or even use the other features available by just asking Alexa. The unit is well built and I really like the charging cradle provided.,pos
Good loud sound. Very good speaker. Convenient voice commands to take outside of house.,pos
"This device can be a very load speaker, I mean really LOUD. It also can access AMAZON prime service without a computer. I like this little Tap.",pos
"Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected.",pos
It's great just wish it did not need a button to work. Otherwise love it!,pos

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited .

"I should have done some research before buying the Tap. I would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated. Also, I thought it would be more like Siri where you can ask anything. Alexa's answer to most questions is, ""I don't understand the question."" The Bluetooth speaker works fine.",neg
Love the sound that comes out and Alexa is very informative!,pos
Camera was perfect for my daughter... she's in yearbook at school and fell in love with it...,pos
Great for travel. It is very loud for its size. Over all I love it.,pos
You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.,neg
I do like the portability of my Tap. You do lose some features from the Echo - like speaking to it from across the room. But i'm happy with it and it has good sound. great to take out by the pool!,pos
"Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc.",pos
Having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do.,neg
"..exactly what I wanted, but the battery drains FAST when on hands free mode.",pos
"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn.",pos
Gift for my wife to listen to her music when she's sewing plus being able to purchase supplies as she runs out.,pos
"I really like the sound of the tab. The only complaint is that you have to push the button every time you have to speak or listen to tab. Unlike the echo, where you just speak and it answers without pushing any buttons. The echo has a cheaper sounding speaker. I'd wait till there is a sale in it before paying full price. Otherwise, it is just like a Bluetooth speaker.",pos
Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Alexa is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that',pos
"I wanted to buy a Tap when it was first released. I have several Echo's in the house, but having a portable Alexa enabled device is awesome. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the tap could not be operated hands-free. I held off purchasing one because I was afraid Amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature.Earlier this year Amazon enabled hands-free mode, and it works almost as well as the Echo, despite having fewer microphones.Sound quality is very good. It's a small speaker but very capable. Battery life is excellent. This is currently the most flexible implementation of Alexa and I recommend it.",pos
you can ask alexa almost anything kids love it Plays all my music,pos
"Bought the echo first, and liked it so much I bought a Tap to add mobility. I carry it around all the time, to the garage, working out, etc.",pos
"great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request.",pos
"I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.",pos
I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.,pos
Chose this over a regular Bluetooth speaker and am so glad I did. Alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done. The sound quality is great. I've used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam.,pos
The portability is nice but misses key elements from the other two.Sound is good but this unit does not allow for the new peak in feature or allow you to add this speaker to play music all thru the house .,neg
"I love this product and that you can take ""Alexa"" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to ""tap"" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device.",neg
It was an unexpected gift. I like this more than the Alexa because this one is portable. It's great for streaming music. My kids use it all the time. Only problem so far is it does not always understand what I'm saying. Especially when saying the name of a radio station. Sometimes takes few tries before I get what I'm looking for. It has great sound when playing music. Talk radio is not as good but understandable. If you want a portable speaker and Alexa this is the one to get.,pos
Great product for when you are on the go.great sound,pos
I like it because we move it around the house &I to the garage and pool area.,pos
"Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house.",pos
It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.,neg
Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal,pos
Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.,pos
I wanted a portable speaker that worked with Amazon prime music. There is nothing in the market right now that does that except for the Tap. For the $100 price its fine. I would rather spend $200 and get a better sound quality speaker though since it will be used outside as well as is in the kitchen.,neg
I love it it does everything I want can't believe how great it is,pos
This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.,pos
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.She loves it, easy to use, speakers are more clear than her other devices Great volume",pos
"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.",pos
"This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing.",pos
This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.,pos
Truly amazing combination of portability and ease of use and good sound.,pos
Great speaker and Echo substitute. This is great for on the go as a Bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the Alexa app.,pos
Before I bought this I had a blue tooth speaker and an iPod touch. Both of which had to be charged and turned on etc. now I just tell Alexa to play music.,pos
"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker.",pos
This is everything the echo is but portable. You're not getting the same sound quality but more than enough for the backyard or beach. A recent update was made to give you the option of using the button or voice activated controls.,pos
We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.,pos
"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the ""button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously.",pos
"Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot.",pos
Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.,pos
"From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!",pos
This is not like the Amazon Echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good...but you will lose bass if it's at max volume (not recommended if you like bass),pos

Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.,pos
"I bought the Amazon Tap when it was on sale. I already had the Amazon Echo and the Dot. The Tap was a pleasant surprise. Speakers aren't as strong as the original Echo, but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable. TheTap will do virtually anything that the more Expensive Echo can do – including hands-free voice commands. Plus, it's portable and has a wireless charger base, so that it stays charged. It is easy to set up if you follow the instructions carefully. It pairs with your home wifi network, and can also act as a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source.",pos
Love being able to use Alexa unplugged. Amazing device!,pos
I enjoy that I can use Alexa and take it around with me. Especially being able to listen to music anywhere I want.,pos
we're early in the stages of home smartness but this is a good start,pos
I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where,pos
Love that it's 'interactive' as long as I'm connected to the wifi or via Bluetooth to my phone! The sound is pretty good - tends to get a little 'tinny' sounding if you turn it up too loud. But overall a good sound. I'm still trying to find Alexa's limits on what she can and can't do!!,pos
"Great sound, almost perfect interactions and portable. I have the dot and now the tap. The new update allowing voice activation is awesome. Great toy!",pos
Happy to have purchased this one for my birthday and this is the best,pos
With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.,pos
Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product,pos
This was a gift had no plan to purchase one. But very pleased with the portability and the sound quality,pos
It is great to take my Tap on the road. Easy to use and sounds great.,pos
The Amazon Tap has great sound and plays most of my requests. Easy to use and easy to set up.,pos
Product is great. Does a good job at interpreting voice commands. Every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection.,pos
Fun gadget for adults and kids. Great range for asking questions..,pos
This is an excellent product - speaker quality is amazing.,pos
Great outside speaker and alexa is really great to use.,pos
"Good sound but unlike Echo, you have to press a button on the device to have it do what you want it to do. I ordered a Dot so this may solve that issue.",pos
The Amazon Tap has great sound and is responsive to requests for the songs and music I like. It has a rechargeable battery and is portable which is great for taking your music with you as you move around. Thumbs up for the Tap!,pos
"You know, for about a year now I've been thinking of getting a portable speaker, so when the Tap was on sale I decided that this was the perfect answer since I was already committed to the Alexa paradigm.",pos
"This is a great buy for music, news and any kind of information you want.",pos
"This product works great as a little helper and as a great speaker for music. I purchased this for my mother in a nursing home, she loves it! It is very easy to set up and use.",pos
It works well it takes time for it to know your vocabulary,pos
"Now that you don't have to actually tap it to get the full function out of it, its great. Have the original Echo, and the Dot also. Wish I had only bought two of these, the charge is great and we take it wherever we want to go.",pos
Great to use as a portable speaker to take around with you as you work outside as long as you have a wifi connection. I use it with Pandora and Amazon unlimited music.,pos
i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.,pos
I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate,pos
"Great Amazon tap, you can take Alexa anywhere. Love it, can do the big Alexa can do and more! No know issue safer...",pos
This is a good alternative to the amazon echo. I like that supposedly it's not listening all the time and you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa but at the same time you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa.,pos
"Amazon has been the leader in this space of voice recognition and with the AWS engine behind it, there's a lot of opportunity for development, both from the community as well as Amazon. Naturally they favor interaction with services they sell, so others will need to build links to others, but the development environment seems to support a lot of innovation already. The price of this TAP was outstanding, adding it to my existing ECHO and now considering a DOT.",pos
"other than not being voice activated like the Echo, it's just as good if not better",pos
sound is greatdifficult to connect with hotel wifi'sseems durable,pos
"While it seemed to work fine, the Tap does not have the open mic feature. While that can be best for some, I bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens. The Tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with Alexa, which seems to defeat the purpose.",neg
Love it's portability and and sound love all my Amazon echo items,pos
"I have owned three versions of the amazon echo: the original, the dot, and the tap. This is the most versatile of the three. The wireless recharging is great. The sound is not as good as the original, but the portability makes up for this. At $79 it was a fantastic buy.",pos
"I love my smart portable speaker. It has games, weather, news, podcasts, radio stations, etc.If something is missing, I can connect my Bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application I want.",pos
Sleep design and works great. Ideal gift for the person who has everything.,pos
"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly.",pos
I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.,neg
I liked it as it was a great price and the size was the major factor... Not too big and bulky compared to others.,pos
Amazon Tap is awesome! Very happy with the purchase!,pos
"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good.",pos
This is one of the coolest new inventions around. It is very innovative and works great. It's really neat asking Alexa to play different songs and telling it you are bored.,pos
This is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf products. It is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plugs. Great sound and portability.,pos
I wanted the technology but didn't want something that listens to the ever-present conversation in my home. The Amazon Tap fit the bill since one must tap its button to get it to listen.It works and works very well.,pos
"I bring it when hanging out outside, exercising, doing housework anywhere my echo won't hear me",pos
"I utilize my Tap on my bedside table for wake up calls, playing rain sounds to help me go to sleep, set reminders for the middle of the night uh-ohs and play my fav music. I take my Tap to work with me as a cordless battery bluetooth speaker . . . best of both worlds.",pos
Does as advertise. Good for bedroom and you can plug in external speakers.,pos

Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.,pos
Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.,pos
There's a lot of features and we are just getting started with Tap. Glad we made the purchase!,pos
I love my new toy. Alexa is my personal girl Friday. She understands what I want and retrieves it. Easy to set up and use.,pos
"best portable speaker I've ever owned. I use this everyday, mostly when getting ready in the morning or when I have guests over. Good sound quality and links to the Alexa app just like an Echo. It come with a charging base that allows you to not have it plugged in unlike the Echo. Also connects to a mobile device via bluetooth or aux cord.",pos
great sound easily portable around the house both inside and outside. the option to have it automatically respond without pushing the button was a surprise but a welcome one!,pos
"Love having the wireless tap to use anywhere. It's small, sound is good. charges up quickly. Bough the sling to protect it outside.",pos
"Must have for people who have an Amazon Prime account and an Echo. Portability and water resistant. Works great by the hot tub or pool, and let's you access the normal Alexis capabilities.",pos
"I have been enjoying the amazon tap for two weeks, and am still finding new things it will do",pos
"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most.",pos
Lets me choose the type of music I love. Can even go to the beach with me using my sling.,pos
Took awhile to get connected to my home wifi but now that it is it streams flawlessly with no lags in music. Doesn't have the dynamic sound range as other Bluetooth speakers i own.,pos
It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station,pos
"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no handsyou can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",pos
This worked well as an extension of the Amazon Echo to cover our basement living area.,pos
This is a great addition to my expanding smart home. The speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive.,pos
It is a great addition to my home office. My Alexa is upstairs.,pos
I love using this as a speaker for my MacBook. I keep it in my office and use it daily!,pos
Great service I loved all of the items and were great gifts,pos
So glad I purchased this productive it use it all the time,pos
Enjoying my Amazon Tap portable Bluetooth and Wi-F Speaker. It's everything I thought it would be an MORE!,pos
"If you like the Amazon Echo and want it to be portable, this is the solution. The stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is. The built in Alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized (and priced) portable speakers.",pos
"I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the ""tap"" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only...",pos
"I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach.",pos
Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift,pos
This is awesome addition to the stationary Echo. I can take this out in the yard or garage when working outside. Great sound and long battery,pos
It is a very handy device and I highly recommend it. I also enjoy using Alexa on it.,pos
"Easy setup, love that its wireless and its fun talking to Alexa as she gives excellent information.",pos
"Amazon Echo is great. But it is stuck at home. Amazon Tap on the other hand goes everywhere. In the short time we have had ours, we have brought it to Sweden, Portugal, the lake up north and friend's houses. It has served as a music host at card games, answered questions and added things to our shopping list. It is easy to set up Amazon Tap to a wifi network using the Alexa app on your smartphone. You can also easily pair several devices to the Tap via Bluetooth. What really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated. New skills and capabilities are made available on a regular basis. Amazon really hit home with the Tap as the voice interface is so easy to use, and the portability makes it a great.",pos
"More than you average portable bluetooth speaker. Can stream from amazon, spotify, pandora, etc. As the namesake says, give it a tap to ask Alexa any questions, add to your list, order something on Amazon, etc.Battery life is good, and speaker is decent, but can't compete your UE or JBL.",pos
"great device to listen to music,best blue tooth on the market today,I highly recommend it",pos
"I was a little skeptical at first about the Amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up, I was able to connect to my music library with ease! Great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me!",pos
Great additional piece to go with Echo. If you want a additional unit you can't beat this product and the price!,pos
Its very nice and not as big as the echo. Didn't know there was a Tap available to buy.,pos
"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up.",neg
"very interesting device, but having to touch button is a pain sometimes.if that would bother you, then go with Echo.",pos
Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..,pos
"I absolutely love this speaker. It is easy to use and the app is user friendly. I have used it at the beach, pool, lake, and park I will not travel without it.",pos
"Easy set up and amazing usefulness, love it. I use it all the time and continue to find new ways to take advantage of all there is within Alexa. Will purchase another one for bedroom!",pos
It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends,pos
We really enjoy our Alexa. I always have it for music. Lately we been movie times. The kids like to ask it silly questions and they can't get enough of it,pos
Good speaker. I've learned to really like Alexa. She's more than a speaker. Lots of options. Carry it around for use on our outside decks.,pos
Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!,pos
"Hi Everyone, Alexa is the best of the best. I feel like she knows me more and more each week. She is a STRONG speaker for my love of music. She knows like everything ever. I ask her crazy facts and she always responds with something. She does struggle a little with recent events. But that will get better with time. She is my home personal assistant and assists with managing my calendar. In a word. AWESOME!",pos
"I bought this unit because I needed a portable bluetooth speaker. When it was on sale, I figured why not get Alexa with it. It works well. I plan to use it when I am overseas in my hotel. We'll see how that goes.",pos
"Love that the Tap is portable. Drag it all around the house and outside. I'm not an audiophile, but I think the sound quality is very good except at the highest level. Only wish it was always listening when it is charging on the dock.",pos
I feel like I have been completely lied to about this device. Despite reviews claiming a hands free mode that does not exist in the settings. I just downloaded the app for the first time today and there is no hands free option to enable in settings. And Pandora said it's not available in the US on this Amazon tap. Thanks for ruining a birthday Amazon,neg
"I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift.",pos
"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.",neg
"Music, full home automation control, an assistant, calling, shopping and lists, much much more...anywhere with wifi, home or away. Get one, you will not regret it.",pos
Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.,pos
"Smaller then what i expecting, alexa sounds loud and clear. Music sounds great, just make sure you enable alexa hands free so you dont have to hit the button",pos
We bought to give away at a Halloween party. We own them ourselves and they are awesome,pos
Very enjoyable and easy for listening to music selections online. It sounds very good for it's size.,pos
I wanted to get a portable Bluetooth speaker that I could use while out as well as at home. The tap has great sound quality and Alexa is more useful than I would have thought.,pos
This speaker has some kick. The sound quality is great that this little speaker is able to put out,pos
"The Tap has been wonderful! We use it as a timer, for a weather update and for general music. The sound is terrific. I would recommend this unit. It is certainly easy to use - just a tap away.",pos
"I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base.",pos
"I have several echo dots around my home, but this makes it easier for me to carry into a room that doesn't have one and control things around the house, listen to the news or music. It holds a great charge.",pos
Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.,pos
Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.,pos
"Alexa {speaking from the Amazon Tap) is great to have around ! Current news, personal planning details as well as details that might have been forgotten are all available from Alexa..... The Tap sits next to my bed on the nite stand where I can easily call up ijnfo from my bed or as I walk by during the day or nite. Especially useful for a review of my calendar so I can review my upcoming days plans. Try Alexa in a store and my guess is you will want her at your house!",pos
Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!,pos
Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....,pos
"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype.",neg
"I bought this to listen to music. I do not use the Alexa feature all that much. The feature does work great, but it gets annoying having to press the button vs how on the echo you just speak. The speakers work great. I can hear the music crystal clear throughout the majority of my house while playing it. Bass is decent. I would recommend to someone.",pos
Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.,pos
"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess.",pos
I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.,pos
I purchased the Amazon Tap when it was on sale for around $80. The sound is amazing (unlike my Amazon Echo it has stereo speakers!) and the battery life is great! It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can stream from the internet or from your mobile device. Highly recommended!,pos
"Speakers has an excellent quality, despite the small size.The only disadvantage is the Amazon Echo feature, not present in this one, which you can just ""call"" Alexa and she will answer you. In this one, as the name says, you need to ""tap"" the button to wake Alexa up.",pos
"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too.",pos
Tap makes a great mobile Alexa device. Not as loud as Echo but still louder than the Dot. Voice enabled Alexa works but doesn't detect voice as easy as the Echo or Dot. As a mobile Bluetooth speaker though it works fine.,pos
"This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting",pos
I have an Amazon Echo and an Amazon Dot. Love the functionality. Decent sound for what they are. I just wanted something portable for outside.,pos
This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!!,pos
We have the tap and the echo. I wouldn't buy another tap. It's the voice activation that is so good. But if you don't mind having to push the button for every command then the tap is ok. But for me... only echo.,neg
Bought this for our 7 and 5 year old. They love to play music and ask questions about science. Lots of fun!,pos
"Best Buy was running a sale on these and I thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I'm an Apple guy so Siri has been my ""go to"" virtual assistant. I must say that I am duly impressed with Alexa. She seems to understand me better than Siri does. All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better. But none have all the convenience of Alexa, Bluetooth, Wifi and portability in one package.I'll be buying more as Christmas gifts!",pos
"I was impressed with the sound of the original Echo, the price of the Dot. The Echo Tap is the best of both and Portable. I have echos in multiple rooms. I got this to bring music outside to the patio. The music has rich bass and clear sound perfect for tunes or talk. Now that SiriusXM is on Alexa too I have access to great music, Howard stern, NFL, MLB and all the rest of the satellite radio content. The great thing about the tap is unlike a normal Bluetooth speaker this one works solo with Alexa and wifi. Even my wife loves it I think she talks to Alexa now more than she talks to me.",pos
"Powerful and quality sound, love the portability. Just don't understand why this one can't read my notifications while the dot can.",pos
Now that this supports hands free access and amazon has discontinued it this is the last chance to get a battery operated echo device.,pos
"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot.",neg
"I bought this for my mother in law to use when she is outside gardening. She had a huuuge portable speaker that didn't sound very good and used many double 'd' batteries. This one sounds better and lasts all day. I was concerned she wouldn't be able to figure it out, but it is so user friendly she has no issues with it. She loves it and that is a good thing.",pos
Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it.,neg
"I absolutely LOVE my Amazon TAP. It in my opinion is the best blue-tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi, the TAP is better than the Echo! Portable - YES! Sound Quality - OFF THE CHARTS! I blue-tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with GREAT Dolby sound quality. The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It's also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool. BEST BUY's PRICE made it ALL THE BEST BUY OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON! I picked up the item same day at a local Best Buy. The Experience was 1 - 2 - DONE. Very convenient, very helpful. I would recommend this to ALL my friends!!!",pos
I believe this is the best Amazon device because of the portability. Quality seems good. Works well with no problems so far. It's a great portable Bluetooth speaker with alexa.,pos
Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package.,pos
"The Amazon Tap is a perfect complement to our Amazon Echo. Put this in our office space...has all the advantages of the Echo and is also a great Bluetooth speaker. Having to ""tap"" the mic button to summon Alexa is no issue at all! Sound quality is as good as any Bluetooth speaker on the market and it's extremely portable.",pos
"I bought 1 of everything. Like this one the best. VERY good sound, grab it off the base and take it to another room or outside and enjoy the music.",pos
"The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Alexa. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!",pos
"I have the Amazon Tap (which I purchased at Best Buy about a month ago) and love it so much I bought one for my son and his family. They love it, too!",pos
I like the product itself but its app is very slow esp. outside the U.S. when you are on the go.,neg
"bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music.",pos
Looking for a radio for the kitchen this works great the more you use it the smarter it gets,pos
Not too satisfied with the sound and it loses Bluetooth connection no matter what phone I use (either Iphone or Android).,pos
Is it operate my wife loves it my granddaughter knows how to operate a good sounding Bluetooth speaker great freedom it even tells knock knock jokes in makes my granddaughter crack up that makes it worth every penny I paid useful to recommend to anybody,pos
Pretty cool kids love it. Always adding things to my grocery list I didn't want.,pos
I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack,pos
Enjoying the product and feel the ease of use is good.,pos
"Smart, timely, very effective around the house. I have a Dot as well but the Tap has MUCH better sound. I had a Google Earth and replaced it with the TAP because Google was not as smart as Tappy!",pos
This is a great product! Would definitely recommend this item!,pos
I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.,pos
"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use.",pos
Great product works direct with internet access or through your phone,pos
good speaker. 8 hour battery. Good price. Excellent quality in how it is made.,pos
"The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money.",pos
"Great speaker, Love using voice commands, Even my granddaughters use the voice command to search for songs.",pos
"Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week.",pos
"Love the sound quality, perfect for what l needed it for.",pos
This speaker is great and not only is it a speaker but it's got the Alexa application!,pos
"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",pos
This is a great product I would highly recommend getting it,pos
"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement.",neg
I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!,pos
"Great speaker, able to move around, connect to iPad when watching movies. Love it!",pos
"This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device.",pos
Excellent product. Lots of upgrades to Tap since original release. A joy to use.,pos
"The Amazon Tap is a great mobile Bluetooth speakers, if you are invested in the Amazon eco-system. The produces good sound at all levels, plays music stored in your associated cloud accounts and does everything else the Echo can do, just with mobility added to it (as opposed to the Echo that always has to be plugged into the wall to work).",pos
Was easy to set up. Excellent sound quality for the price,pos
This has all the benefits of the Echo for a slightly better price. I also love the portability.,pos
"Works great if you plan to have it in arms reach. You have to physically tap it to ask Alexa. Store rep knew what we wanted it for and never told us you had to tap, not voice activate. Returned to wait for indefinite out-of-stock Echo to get in eventually.",neg
Definitely enjoy using this at home. I was surprised at how intuitive it is and was able to answer any question in seconds. I mostly use it to play music through Amazon player. I know there's tons more it can do and can't wait to take advantage of all its capabilities.,pos
For its size this is a pretty well made product that produces great sound and I love the portability.,pos
I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.,pos
Just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.,neg
Great tech works well highly recommended no issues,pos
"This is great for the beach or by the pool. If you already own an Echo, this is a great addition to the household.",pos
Looked at the Echo before we bought this and I would have been a fool to buy it when you have to add a battery to make it portable. This has everything we need and then some.,pos
"It's not the echo but for what I paid, it's well worth every penny",pos
Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.,pos
"Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming",pos
It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift.,pos
Great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions,pos
Tap is a nice bluetooth/wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it questions.Can Sync with your phone via using the Amazon Alexa app.,pos
"I love my Echo Tap! I have my own personal alarm, informs me on today's weather forcast and local events. Great purchase.",pos
"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR",pos
Amazon Tap is exactly what I expected it would be. The sound quality is good with the Alexa features. I love that you can charge it on the base or with micro USB cord. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Amazon Echo and would like the portability.,pos
If you are a Prime member its a good little speaker to have. Need WIFI or Hotspot.,pos
I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.,pos
"I couldn't decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband.",pos
I love this speaker it works wonderfully. Very recommend,pos
Love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery and can be moved with no issues for listening in other rooms. Has a decent amount of Bass for the size.,pos
It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.,neg
"Doesn't understand some commands or Questions,but good overall",pos
"The Amazon Tap is the first step into making your home a smart home. It will act as a brain to everything else. Unfortunately, you'll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights, thermostat, locks, etc. to get the full potential out of it. Alone, it merely acts as a Bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone.",pos
Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions,neg
I enjoy it. It's gray for reading and working out.,pos
Great concept but speaker not so good at full volume. And maybe better now with the updates,pos
This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.,pos
We now have one for everyone in the family and no longer share. I would have no problem recommending this to a friend.,pos
"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution.",neg
"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands…you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",pos
"Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge.",pos
"I can't say enough about the Amazon Tap. I enjoy playing music from it and that it's portable. I can play music from my Amazon prime account, Pandora or from my phone. It is fun to ask Alexa questions. Yes, Alexa cannot answer all my questions or find everything I ask for, but it is still amazing.",pos
"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-",pos
"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.",pos
"This speaker puts out some great sounds and has lots of options for connections. And, it is Alexa commandable.",pos
"I really haven't had a chance to use this much yet, but it seems like a coll little gadget.",pos
Smaller version but works great just like the bigger product.,pos
"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase.",pos
My son requested this a a birthday gift. He is enjoying it everyday.,pos
It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.,pos
If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.,pos
"I bought it for my husband for a gift but I use it as much as he does. Perfect size, good sound quality overall great product.",pos
I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap!,pos
Awesome speaker easy to set up. Easy to play. Great by the pool,pos
Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it.,pos
Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected.,pos
This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap.,neg
Great product for intro to an AI device. Cant wait to upgrade to echo.,pos
"I have the Echo and a Dot and now the Tap, too. My only issue with the Tap is that I got it after the Echo. This means that by the time I got the Tab, I was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my Echo. Of course with the Tap you have to physically get up and touch the Tap. I think if I had first started out with the Tap and having to touch it, it wouldn't be so difficult now for me remember to tap the Tap. But it is a habit to just call out now. So I wish I'd gotten the Tap first and then had graduated to the Echo. Try the Tap first. You might decide you don't even need an Echo. You definitely won't be disappointed !!",pos
"WAS SURPRISED HOW GREAT THIS WORKS , MUSIC ASK IT QUESTIONS AWESOME",pos
Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!,pos
purchased as a gift but I do have the Echo. If the echo works like the Echo it will be great.,pos
"The more I use this, the more reasons I enjoy it. The staff were great and helped me set it up.",pos
Really enjoy the interface and how integrate with the amazon music service .....great,pos
"Have Amazon echo, dot and now the tap. All work very well, and.the tap sounds great.",pos
"If you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device!It works well. Calendar functions, plays radio, most podcasts, can order Domino's. But you have to be aware that most features require to some degree Amazon Prime membership. For example Spotify will not work unless it is a premium account.",pos
Great speaker sound and ease of setup. Works great with Amazon music option.,pos
Amazon is the tip of leading technology. Always have had great luck with their product.,pos
I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo,pos
Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...,neg
Love that you can take this anywhere and hook up to my Bluetooth. Great sound quality.,pos
I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy,pos
Love it I bought it for my mother and father she is easy for them to use and they are in there 70s,pos
"Using it in the kitchen mainly. It has good sound, works excellent as a cooking timer. Also alarm for certain events thruout the day. Nice music source.",pos
This item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands. I like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it,pos
"Bought it as a gift, she loves it. Very entertaining and wonderful volume, having lots of fun with it.",pos
Went with the portable unit for travel. Easy access and portability.,pos
It's very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a bose sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it,neg
"I didn't want something that was always monitoring room conversations. This appears to only listen when I tap it, and that is much more acceptable to me. Works great. :-)",pos
I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.,pos
"I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight.",pos
This is a great piece of hardware...I love it. really good all around..,pos
"In my search for a wireless speaker, I looked at various models and decided on this one because of the portability, the look and how it synced with Alexa. I have an Alexa and this product was spot on! The sound is great! I use it in the balcony and stream all music from pandora, different stations and the quality is great!! Definitely would recommend!",pos
You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.,pos
I bought this as a gift for my father. He absolutely loves it!!,pos
Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.,pos
Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa,pos
Best speaker with Alexa enabled. Value of money!!,pos
Works just like echo but portable!! Great stuff. As described!,pos
Once the tap was able to be activated by voice I started to have some interest. Having said that I notice I do use the 'Tap' button when I have it in my hand. We use it mostly outside and by our hot tub. Took is on vacation this last week and use it at the beach using cell phone as an access point.,pos
"Much more than a Bluetooth speaker. It is great to listen to music from Pandora, Amazon, etc with it streaming directly from wifi. Saves the battery on my phone. As others have said I wish that it had an option of having the voice activation on all times but I guess they didn't put that in to save battery life. Maybe something for the next generation TAp",pos
"I love that this works just like the dot, which I already have 3. However in addition it is portable and has better speaker",pos
I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.,pos
Works great to control Alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes. gets very loud at least. Easily connects to Bluetooth.,pos
"This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family.",pos
"Overall, I am very impressed with the Amazon Tap. The sound quality isn't the best out there, but the portability makes up for this. The volume is decent as well. There were a few issues with connectivity over the holidays, but for the past month it has been flawless. Very satisfied with purchase.",pos
Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up,pos
Love it great speaker as long as u have access to WiFi,pos
I have a few top end Bluetooth speakers and this Amazon tap rates right up with them in sound and built quality plus it has alexa built in,pos
"Purchased as a gift for my husband. He is not a tech person, I was afraid he would be intimidated but he loves it.",pos
"Last Christmas I gave my nephew a fire stick, which he loved. In the meantime, I purchased an Amazon Tap for myself. Since he likes gadgets, I knew he would want one. So I purchased it for him",pos
"This was my first Alexa device and until I got a dot I was very satisfied with it After the Dot, I missed the voice activation. No Amazon has updated the software to where it will respond to voice commands so not problems with it at all . You need to keep it on the charge stand if you are going to use voice commands.",pos
The sound out of this little cylinder is incredible.,pos
No issues at all... wish it were water proof. My kids and family love it.,pos
"We already had an Alexa but this one is a great addition. It's portable, rechargeable and good sound.",pos
"Look at this product as a portable speaker first and an Echo replacement second. The big reason to buy this over standard Bluetooth speakers is this has WiFi streaming enabled. When you are at home you can stream music with ease to it. Voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories. The only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice. If you want bigger sound and always listening features, spend the extra money on the Amazon Echo.",pos
Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.,pos
"Bought the Tap for my mom to primarily listen to music. Although my mom forgets ""the girl's name"" haha, we've found Alexa will answer without saying her name. The rechargeable base is nice so the Tap can be moved around the house or outside within range of wifi. Sound is great, too! Pleased!",pos
"Works great, sound is clear and is really loud. Would recommend",pos
"I have an echo, tap and a dot. Currently my tap serves as a Bluetooth speaker for my dot - making it more like the echo, but i enjoy being able to take the tap anywhere. It has really good sound much like my echo. It also works great in the app and syncs with all my other products.",pos
"I have a regular echo and now the tap. Both awesome products, use them to control lights, locks, and play music. Would buy again.",pos
This item is exactly what I was looking for. It is a perfect size for home or travel. It is very loud for its size.,pos
Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!,pos
works as expected. great Christmas present for the kids.,pos
"I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund",pos
Bought as a family gift. We use it all the time now. Very helpful and covenient,pos
If you have Prime this is the best thing you can buy!,pos
I gave this to my daughter for Christmas because she wanted a portable speaker. I thought the addition of Alexa would be fun. She loves it. She said the sound is really great.,pos
"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",pos
"Good, but not overall as capable or comprehensive as I was hoping. Will continue to explore capabilities and Apps.",pos
I really liked this tablet. Got it for my nephew who just turned 4. Has many built in kid rated apps which keeps him entertained. The bumper is a bonus in case he drops it too. What I also like is that it had another mode to switch to in case an adult wanted to use it too.,pos
"Great product at a great price from Best Buy. Have to press a button rather than just saying her name, but that's the price you pay for it being cordless.",pos
"What I like is it its sound, it's portable and I use it at work. The sound fills the whole office.",pos
"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug.",pos
Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.,pos
"i got one for my mom she's 90 years young and she sits and listens to it all day, she;s got the amazon tap i got my draugther the dot and i got my self another tap. i just found out you can put the tap on hands free and you dont have to tap the button this made it even better. my grand kids love playing ganes with alexa. like i said every household need one",pos
We were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable. We already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. We returned it and exchanged gor the dot.,neg
"I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base.",pos
"This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice.",pos
It's nice and portable and works well on the go. Wished it had the option to be able to use voice commands without pushing the button.,pos
I HAVE PUT THE DOT IN THE BEDROOM WHERE MY ECHO IS IN THE LIVING AREA. MY FAMILY USES HER FOR EVERYTHING. ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ECHO / DOT.,pos
I shopped for a long time until I found this and I am very pleased.,pos
"This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say ""I do not understand your question. """,neg
The sound in this is on par with other high end portable speakers. That however is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking. Also this works if you have Phillips hue so you can turn the lights off and on with your voice.,pos
I am in love with the Alexa Tap. This is a great portable speaker and now that the added function of being able to talk to it without manually pushing the button sets this apart from the rest. I would recommend to all.,pos
This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.,pos
"I have a lot of things in my home automated and we use Alexa as a part of that. I'd wanted a portable Alexa to use in our deck area and first look at a Tap late 2016. I ruled it out because the user had to touch it to enable Alexa which isn't convenient. I purchased a Dot battery pack and it worked okay but once I dropped and broke it, I needed a new solution. I knew that Amazon had added voice activation so I bought a Tap. It is great. Sound quality is good enough for me and it is a semi-rugged Alexa device we can port around outside.",pos
"I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.",pos
"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.",pos
I've enjoyed using the features Alexa app and like the portability that this unit offers. The sound quality is good.,pos
"It has sleep timer capability alarm I use it at work, or use it at home while I'm in the shower and I'll bring it to Friends houses and we use Alexa to gain information or just have fun. quality a 9 its loud too.",pos
"A friend gave me a Dot, which I enjoyed. I decided to explore the other devices. I was torn between the Echo and the Tap. After reading a CNET review, I chose the Tap because it is portable. My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word ""Alexis"", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household.",pos
"I will rate this Amazon Tap a five stars when the application to make the Alexa commands become remote, instead of manually pressing the command button on the unit itself.",pos
Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.,pos
"The Tap offers all of the conveniences of Amazon's Alexa in a battery powered portable bluetooth speaker. It has a hands free option, it works well both as a way to take Alexa on the road and as your primary Alexa device at home., the Tap doesn't sound as good as other Bluetooth speakers in its price range. It's not waterproof and Alexa doesn't work at all without Wi-Fi. but still pretty cool and heaper than the Echo.",pos
Amzon tap is great and fun Bluetooth speaker with inbuilt Alexa. I can talk it to end of the room and it can still understand my commands and plays music. Cool device and I highly recommend it.,pos
"The whole family is using it. Music, Bluetooth speaker, questions, game times, sports scores. Love the portability.",pos
"Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say ""Alexa"" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!",pos
This speaker sound great. I was surprised at how loud it gets. The sound is clear and you also have Alexa so that's a win.,pos
"Love the Dot, Hate the Tap Portable! This device will not hold a charge for even one day. The dots are amazing though.",neg
purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law. he loved it and works well. great sound and loves the portability of the unit.,pos
Great companion if you already have an echo and need something on the go. Love that this stream and plays Prime music. Battery life could be a little better and sound is good for speaker this size but not the best.,pos
It's a nice item but really there's other things that do the same thing. So we actually returned it.,pos
It works as describe on the box. I didn't research a lot but I did read about it a little.,pos
The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.,pos
Awesome. I really enjoy using it. The portability is a plus!,pos
Great speaker. Love how its portable. Good battery life. Would be 5 stars if it had the drop in capabilities like the rest of the echo family.,pos
I spent more time trying get it functioning than I did actually keeping this product. After a couple of days and never getting it to understand or follow my commands I returned it to BB. Also it kept trying to sell me products which I really didn’t appreciate.,neg
Was very difficult to set up. With the 3 hours help of Geek Squad and my granddaughters I-Phone we got it done.,pos
Good product but requires hands on to operate. Good if sitting close but not if you're mobile. Wold be great if portable and hands free. Returned it and ordered the Dot.,pos
"the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79",neg
The ease of Alexa in performing functions is second to none. SIRI who?,pos
"I( read the reviews and even listened to this in store. But much to my chagrin, at high volume, this will not cut it. The portability is great!",pos
"Tap is a versatile device that serves as a music repository with on demand playback features and surprisingly high quality sound. AI app Alexa responds to commands and requests for information promptly with some occasional minor glitches. Overall a handy and very portable device for quality music playback and as a knowledge base access tool,",pos
"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats",pos
"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!",pos
"This has been a very nice addition, it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it.",pos
I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.,neg
This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button,pos
"This is a great on-the-go speaker. I like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in. Also, bonus: Alex. I like the update they have done to it as well where you don't have to push the button to activate her, you can just say her name. If you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much, choose this one. Spend more,m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound, but you can't travel with it.",pos
The tap is amazing. portable and connected to all amazon content,pos
"I am a huge fan of the echo. That being said this is the last one I would buy. The original echo's speaker sounds much better and is hands free. The dot has great connection Bluetooth and more importantly audio out to plug into a stereo system. I bought this for the purpose of being able to carry outside around the house when working in the yard. The sound is not as robust as the original echo (not portable - no internal battery), but good enough when in the yard to at least have music.",pos
I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys amazon. Excellent value.,pos
"Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the ""home"" button to use Alexa",pos
"I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing.",pos
The speaker sounds very decent for the size and cost but my favorite thing about the speaker is it is wireless and portable. I can charge the speaker and practically take it anywhere without having to plug it in.,pos
"Speaker is really cool. Sounds great, easy to use. Love the fact that it is portable. Only downside I see from the more expensive model is you have to tap the button (not always listening)",pos
The tap is a great product! Access to Alexa in a grab and go format!,pos
This speaker has great sound and is very easy to use.,pos
"Was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone (doesn't need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our Echo Dot), but was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and volume! We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its ""Hands-Free"" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)...",pos
Mostly just use it for the speaker. Still waiting on the no touch feature they are adding.,pos
"I added to a ""dot"" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift!",pos
"I like its flexibility, portability and it is the best value option of all three Alexas",pos
For the price this Amazon is amazing. Just like the echo but smaller. I show everyone how great it is.,pos
Love it ... need to get some smart appliances! I also got the Echo dot - wish I got these items sooner,pos
My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.,pos
This is so easy to operate and fun too! I love it!!,pos
Great product with a ton of features. Add the Echo Dot to get even more out of it,pos
"Fun and easy to use, install app and navigation.Good quality technology.",pos
This is such a great product I have two of them! Would highly recommend.,pos
I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo. It is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact Alexa. The wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect!,pos
I have the Echo and I just love it... I bought the Tap for my daughter for Christmas so she does not know she has it yet.,pos
Great sound in a small package for the money and I would buy again.,pos
"Love, love, love this! Can't wait to use it on our deck this summer!",pos
"Easy set up, tons of music, easy to use. If you are looking for voice activated, this is not it.",pos
Makes for a great alarm and reminder device. I own 2 dots and the tap. Use them all.,pos
"Same features as Echo now, but easier to move around the house as needed w/you.",pos
I love its portability! The speakers are phenomenal!,pos
Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound,pos
Brought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it! Great product for the price.,pos
I love Alexa! She has been a great addition! Would recommend her to anyone,pos
My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.,pos
It's amazing! I love how loud it plays the music!!,pos
Great Speaker but I really don't need the features. I just need good sound and don't really use anything besides that,pos
"With the new update allowing hands-free ""Hey Alexa"" commands, this is a great device. The battery allows you to disconnect from the wall. The sound is very good and fills a small room well with decent levels. Alexa is very accurate (most of the time) to voice commands. My only complaint is that Bluetooth streaming from devices (like my iPhone or iPad) sometimes breaks up and stutters a bit. Other than that, I think this is a great device.",pos
I would recommend it. It is fun to use and puts out good sound.,pos
I love this .. Great extra for my amazon echo .. Does everything it does but it's cordless .. Keeps charge for many days .. Push button to activate .. Wireless speaker also out of wifi .. Really cool !!,pos
I love this product. Great sound quality and at a good price,pos
I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap,pos
Don't know how I managed without Alexa. Everyone in the family is enjoying her.,pos
I have an Amazon Echo and the Amazon Tap works wonderfully with Echo. The sound quality is great. It is easy to use and set up. It beats turning on the receiver for music. If you are looking for great and easy sound machine the Tap is it.,pos
Sounds great. Must touch to activate. Easy to use.,pos
"Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must ""Tap"" the button before speaking.",pos
Has good sound for little speaker & good for getting information with out getting up.,pos
Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap!,pos
This speaker is great for the price. I love how the speaker is 360 degrees so you get the same sound in any part of the room.,pos
It has a good sound. The battery last long and it connects easily to WiFi and blue tooth. But you have to touch a button before you speak to it.,pos
What a terrific device. You can ask it anything and she has an answer. It's small enough to place anywhere so it doesn't look instructive,pos
"Always loved the Amazon Echo. Now we can rake it with us, outside, wherever!",pos
"easy to use , sound is great, i use it any where in the house",pos
"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works.",pos
"Bought this on Deal of the Day which surprised me since it is new to Best Buy. Just push the button and ask ""her"" to do something such as play favorite radio station or music from play list. Have ""her"" set timers and alarms to wake by. I haven't used half of the features of TAP. The sound is amazingly great for such a small device.",pos
"Didn't know I would like it this much, but it's wonderful. I use it mostly for streaming music from Pandora. I love that I don't have to rely on another device and connect via bluetooth like other speakers and the sound it great!",pos
Loud enough for small gatherings & very responsive to commands.,pos
"Fantastic, better response then SIRIAmazon Prime account gives you complete control",pos
I bought this as a Christmas gift and it sounds amazing. And of course the integration is wonderful too.,pos
"A nice complement to the Alexa family. The sound quality is nearly as good as the original Echo, and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by, particularly for the price.",pos
Bought it for Father's Day and my dad and mom love it!,pos
I like the Amazon Tap. I use it as a speaker in my garage for working out. It is tied to my Amazon Echo. I am able to use Alexa and Amazon Prime material. Would highly recommend.,pos
He loves electronics around Christmas so this was right up his alley! He loves telling Alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs,pos
"Gave as a gift.Did not know you had to ""tap"" it before you talk. Thought it was like echo.Anyway, they still love it and does not mind pushing the button to talk.Really likes that it is battery powered, portable.",pos
"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially pos if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more",
These things are cool! With the new muti room music options I can have the same song playing in each room. Not to mention the intercom! Great item!,pos
This is a must for Prime members great sound and can be used as Bluetooth speaker to boot.,pos
Love having someone to take notes for me and play music on demand.,pos
"I love my Amazon Tap. I was in the market for a portable speaker and I saw these one on sale so I decided to pick it up. I only wanted it for a Bluetooth speaker, but Alexa is amazing I use it everyday. Alexa was a huge plus.",pos
My Echo hasn't updated to the latest version that allows for hands-free operation. I'm not sure what the problem is.,pos
"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.",pos
Even as a speaker alone this item is worth the price!,pos
I really enjoy it love the sound and it's really easy,pos
Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.,pos
The kids love it. They ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer. I really like for the music aspect. Just tell it a song and it finds it,pos
"I purchased a Echo for home so added a Tap for my office at work, so I can chat with Alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent BT speaker for my office. This has great sound streaming my Prime music and XM vis the XM app. Can't go wrong. Quality music and Alexa when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Pick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out.",pos
"I already own the Amazon Echo, so for smart speaker, it is one of the most handy devices out there. There is so many things you will find that you can do with it and the list keeps growing. Since the software update that allows you to use ""Always On"" voice commands like its big brother, it has become my go to device.Pros:- Wireless Bluetooth Smart Speaker - I take it to work and use it in the car, even when I travel for work- Sync's up with my popular music aps (Spotify, Pandora, etc)- Alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly- The best Alarm Clock- I sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips- Speaker is able to get loud- Control smart devices like lighting and my ecobee - Option to turn Off/On voice commands, can use tap button instead- Very long range for voice commandsCons:- Only single band Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz- Battery life when using ""Always On"" voice commands is short- Speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other Bluetooth speakersOverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs, with only minimal cons. I use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion.Tip for BESTBUY: You should carry cases for this device as I had to get my protector elsewhere",pos
"Besides the missing app functionality (check compatibility before purchasing), it does exactly what I want it to.",pos
"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo.",pos
Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.,pos
Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.,pos
"We already have an echo so I didn't think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it. Now we use it everyday -- mostly to stream Amazon prime, TuneIn, or Pandora channels.It is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when I was a kid -- having a ""beat box"" to carry around room to room and outside. We use the tap as a 2016 version of a ""beat box"" that is much smaller, rechargeable, and way easier to tune! And with side benefits of controlling our lights, HVAC, and with Alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions.The sound quality could be a bit better, but surprisingly good. Adjusting the volume isn't as easy as it should be. The battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well.",pos
"This is a fun and convenient toy, but I'm surprised about some of the limitations. I keep hearing the same NPR news clip when I ask for news or headline news. I would like more news highlights. When I ask for 80s music, Echo starts with the same 1 of 3 songs each time.",pos
"Love it, works better than anticipated. Also at a good price",pos
Awesome product. Enjoy using it everyday. Would definitely recommend,pos
"Tap is a portable Amazon Echo with speakers. Great for carrying to basement or upstairs. Works like echo but not voice activated, you must ""tap"" it before talking.",pos
Nice price for a gift idea at the time. Small compact version of Alexa.,pos
"It's very easy to connect devices, and it produces a good sound. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",pos
"I bought the Amazon Tap when it was on sale. I already had the Amazon Echo and the Dot. The Tap was a pleasant surprise. Speakers aren't as strong as the original Echo, but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable. TheTap will do virtually anything that the more Expensive Echo can do  including hands-free voice commands. Plus, it's portable and has a wireless charger base, so that it stays charged. It is easy to set up if you follow the instructions carefully. It pairs with your home wifi network, and can also act as a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source.",pos
I like it. I use it everyday and so far no cons. Im very please.,pos
I literally use this thing every single day. Love it.,pos
I absolutely love my amazon echo. It is very convenient and handy.,pos
"This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice activation, but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it.",pos
This stuff tastes great. It does have sugar in it. I wasn't planning on that.,
"The Amazon Fire TV works better and faster than the Fire Stick. Every aspect of this is better, watching every show or movie starts up fast and is much clearer.",pos
I like the product and would tell others about it.,pos
"Really like the voice commands, including commands outside the typical, movie/tv expectation (like the weather). Haven't used it as much as i thought i would, but set up (for the things i want to do) is fair....",pos
Got it so I can have everything in one device and it does that flawless. It's very fast and responsive and the voice search is really good,pos
Like the voice command option to search for shows I want to watch.,pos
"Decent, but have to reset monthly, i have to unplug and at times re enter my pass cause this freezes or stops completely. You can add KODI though. i would still but one for living rm though.",pos
Great purchase and good investment.Also wonderful viewing,pos
Follow the instruction on youtube and you can jailbreak this item to get access to movies still in theaters.,pos
"Works as described, happy with the purchase.got another one for the room ..",pos
Works exactly as I hoped and have had no issues. There is virtually every app you might need available to you.,pos
"I really get the most of my Amazon Prime Video now. I find it is easy and responsive to use. The main pain is having to change the Input so you have to use three controllers, the media controller, the cable controller and the original TV controller. Fortunately I'm used to that with my Apple TV. It is less fussy than the Apple TV especially when you view Amazon content. Well it naturally would be because the content is automatically there.",pos
I don't know why i waited to long to get this product especially since i have amazon prime. Gives me instant access to prime movies and has built in alexa what more can you ask for. Simply great .,pos
It's processor is super fast plus plays movies & tv shows so clear! I love it!! Best money I ever spent!!,pos
"I recently got rid of cable and WiFi at home as it all just became way too expensive. I wanted something that would run off of my hotspot on my phone as I have an unlimited plan. It connects to it as soon as I have it on, there is no lagging, doesn't take long to load any of my streaming services either. It is very easy to navigate through the menu and do everything. Steup was a breeze, I love the voice feature (definitely comes in handy).",pos
Fire box was a perfect up grade to my TV entertainment system. The ability to show 4k movies made it perfect. My daughter gets to see her cartoons and I get to see my action movies perfectly. You can use Ethernet and dual band wifi. Its so much in a small box with a low price. ITS PERFECT!,pos
Easy connection and very good playing different apps.,pos
"This device is very easy to set up as long as you know your wifi password, Amazon account information, and a TV with an available HDMI port. FYI...You must have an Amazon account to use this device.",pos
"I bought this and an AppleTV at the same time. The FireTV is just kinda OK. The interface isn't that intuitive and could use some polish. I had to enter the same username and password for multiple apps over and over (you only have to do it once on the AppleTV)...may not sound like that big of a deal, but it took much longer to setup.In my opinion, the AppleTV is a better product.",neg
"I had the Fire stick, and the performance was sluggish at best, constant buffering and powering off. I upgraded to the Fire tv and the difference is night and day. I don't know why I waited! no issues thus far and I couldn't be happier.",pos
Way better than the Amazon stick. No buffering love it,pos
We enjoy this product more than our roku device. It works great.,pos
"I love everything about this item. I can watch whatever, whenever, particularly on Kodi. Good bye and good riddance to cable!",pos
"I returned this and purchased the 4th generation Apple TV instead, I liked the Apple features better. If you're not",pos
this is best box I ever buy to watch movies and tv shows,pos
"BYE BYE CABLE TV, KODI ON THE FIRE TV TAKES OVER..YES SIR",pos
This fire TV is really awesome for viewing content the Amazon video is really great and has lots of content,pos
"I'm mostly happy, but like so many electronics, this one has a huge of built in advertising that you just can't get away from. There is no way to identify the aps you want to see first, and it always defaults the first click to an advertised movie for sell. It takes many clicks to get where I want, and the voice only works for purchases from Amazon, everywhere else you have to use the keyboard using clicks.",neg
Comes with a bunch of apps to watch TV and to play games as well.,pos
Best purchase you will ever make. Intall kodi and go cable free,pos
I had a fire stick but I gave it away to a family member. I then went to purchase another one but they only had the fire tv in stock. So I reluctantly brought it but I am so much happier now that I have a tv box.,pos
"Cable is too expensive. Especially when you can buy this and get more than you ever expected. You can expand the memory at will, you can watch literally anything, and although the remote is awful, there's an iPhone app that allows you to toss that unreliable remote in the trash. Get this thing, thank me later.",pos
"Works great, easy to use. Affordable, worth the cost.",pos
its a good box if you dont mind the amazon restrictions,pos
It works well for what I am using it for. To access shows.,pos
I bought when this was on sale. Good investment!!!,pos
"I recently decided to be a cord cutter and not have cable anymore, just internet. I currently have a Samsung 60"" Smart 4K UHD and the Samsung 4K Blu-Ray player and a PC that I use to access all my online content.I decided to try the Amazon Fire TV and discovered that I already have access to just about everything the Amazon Fire TV has through mny TV, Blu-ray player and PC.This is a great device but for me it was just redundant.",pos
Works awesome!! I would recommend getting one fast!!,pos
This is so much faster than the fire stick. It also provides full support for sling tv and PlayStation vue which Apple TV has not. This has replaced our Apple TV as the primary streamer.,pos
"This is a great product. But, may not be worth the extra money. You can likely get away with buying the Fire Stick.",pos
"Amazon Fire TV is a great addition to our household. It offers tons of programs and I love getting my amazon prime movies this way. Easy to install, easy to navigate the menu, and an overall A+ in my book.",pos
"After receiving another extremely high cable bill, I decided to cut the cord! The Amazon Fire is awesome. We subscribed to Playstation Vue which has an app on the Fire that you can access.We can also access our Amazons and Netflix accounts right from the Fire. Great product, wish I would have done this sooner.",pos
"Fast, easy, and mobile! Connects through WiFi and directly. Easy to move from one room to another.",pos
"Easy to use, I'm able to move it to other tvs in the house and bring it with us on vacation",pos
Awesome! Really small size and fits perfect without taking a lot of space on the entertainment rack. Love it so far! 4K is awesome and definitely recommended! Make sure you are using the HDMI port specifically for HDCP 2.2 on your TV.,pos
Works great! I like it better than cable. My new favorite device to watch movies and tv shows. My kids like the games that are available.,pos
I had the firestick but upgraded to the box. Easy to use and with the straight connection to the Internet it is super fast.,pos
"I have been a user of Roku and Apple TV before and I absolutely love the Fire TV. What prompted me to change from Roku was the availability of Playstation Vue. We are cord cutters and Vue is a better value than Sling TV.The Fire TV works well and has most all the channels we used on our old Roku. The only thing that doesn't work 100% is Vudu or other UltraViolet streaming services. The closest thing is Flixster, but some of the titles don't carry over right away. Most of the movies come through just fine, but the Flixster app on the Fire TV doesn't seem to bring over the TV shows I have purchased. Other than that, it works very well. Of course, if you watch a lot of Prime TV or use Amazon's Instant Video service you will really love the integration here.",pos
Would recommend this to a friend. We are enjoying it a lot.,pos
The best streaming device of all the ones i have tried.,pos
Very fast and reliable fits easy behind tv upload apps and view video in 4000k,pos
fast loading no buffering on the best price on market for streaming.,pos
This is by far the best thing I could have bought.,pos
Love my fire tv. Much better and faster than the fire stick.,pos
This product is excellent would recommend to other people keeps all my stuff in on Unit,pos
"Amazon Fire TV is really easy to setup. It also has given me an easy way to stream 4K media for any service, Amazon, Netflix, etc. The quality of the picture and sound is really good. The menu is easy to follow, and it is so much more advanced than the Apple TV. I especially like the App you can use to control The Fire TV from my I-phone or I- Pad.",pos
Was looking for something different but see such a good deal,pos
Great for doing the cord cutting. So far so good..,pos
I was told by buying a new receiver that listed Netflix on the box that it was a good deal. Not so. Best Buy explained how this worked and saved me a lot of money. Gotta love this place!!,pos
This product is amazing and I would recommended to anybody!!!,pos
"Bought this to replace xfinity cable tv with playstation vue. the quality of the picture is excellent and with all of the others apps, music, and movies from amazon prime you absolutely cannot beat this product. i highly recommend.",pos
My favorite streaming box. Works flawlessly and am very pleased with the item.,pos
As always amazon delivers.. LOL On par with apple TV. Great product.,pos
bought the amazon fire to watch PlayStation vueso far so good,pos
"Faster than the fire stick and more memory, so less maintenance. I would of given 5 stars, but you have to buy a hdmi cable unlike the stick which just plugs in.",pos
"Pros:-Fast-nice looking interface-good design-great voice search-good amount of most useful appsCons:-It can get tedious to scroll all the way to right to find the app you want.-They have many of the ""main"" apps but they're still missing quite a few apps that are available on other set-top boxes (Cinemax, Vudu, apps offering 4K content, etc.)-They don't have enough games considering they make the gaming aspect one of their main points of advertising.- Only 8GB of space and you can't use the MicroSD card as extended storage until they upgrade to Marshmallow.- Very Amazon-centricPlease be aware that you cannot play many of the games you can play on your Fire tablet or even your Android phone with Amazon appstore on the Fire TV.",neg
"I recently dropped my cable provider and i had been using the Amazon Firestick which works great. The Fire TV was on sale and, since we have 2 tvs, i bought it. Couldn't believe the beautiful picture on my Samsung tv. I subscribed to HBO, Amazon Prime, and Showtime so I dropped my monthly bill with Directv from $190 to $30 and i have a ton more content.",pos
Performance and interface are great!!! And you can add most of Android apps too!!!,pos
Fantastic streaming device with plenty of options. Love the voice controlling remote!,pos
Outstanding I love this device highly recommend it for anybody and everyone user-friendly,pos
"We have two firesticks but, now they will be replaced with the fire tv box.",pos
Very fast awesome product...worth the money and i would definitely recommend.,pos
There are free an paid games get the stick w/voice,pos
Amazon Products are easy to use and navigate thru.,pos
I can't figure out how to use without switching out the hd1 plugs continuously .,neg
I like it very much good product . I used every day,pos
works as intended and this is the 2nd unit purchased,pos
Great addition to the family room. Movies on demand and very smooth streaming!,pos
"Fast and easy to use. Perfect for Playstation VUE and Plex, clear picture, quick and intuitive interface.",pos
"Overall dynamite product, it gives you instant access to a variety of shows.",pos
"My kids love it they watch their programs when they want and also we don t have to miss any programs also we can watch them when ever we have time, best purchase I have brought.",pos
Great funtionality and the remote with voice control is great. Better expierence than chromecast. The remote and streaming quality is superior than the chromescast solution.,pos
is no word happy happy it hard to get up cause there no commercial so l have to fix something to eat before watching a move or do what l need to do frist so many movies it hard to pick what to watch,pos
Wonderful product-couldn't do without it-thoroughly enjoy It-if you are a PRIME member you get to watch TV shows and movies through prime free.,pos
Processor is speedier than the Fire stick and almost no lags. HD quality content readily available.,pos
Great item for someone looking to cut the cord. The selections are endless.,pos
First one died within hours of setting it up. Returned and reluctantly got a second. This one has been solid.... So far.,pos
"Best Buy had a sale on the FireTV and I jumped at it. I was most interested in the speed increase over our FireTV Stick. I have been very pleased with the upgrade. I like having a microphone on the remote to do voice searches... or now Alexa commands (""turn on the lights"", ""trigger"" IFTTT scripts). The speed over launching a navigate apps is much improved (we have been using PS Vue a good bit).Very pleased :)",pos
The box is really good and it has everything to you need to watch when it comes to online watching,pos
"This device is great for any streaming needs, with a quad core mobile processor and 2 gb of ram this device has no problems handling any of your digital needs. Not to mention the AC wireless receiver and option to plug in usb devices and sd cards. I would highly recommend this device for anyone",pos
The Fire TV works great. Bought it mainly for my kids to watch their shows in their room without adding another cable box and wiring to my home. I am an Amazon Prime Member and the free content available is sufficient for all the kids regardless of age. We're talking 6 to 20 years old! The remote was a little temperamental at first but has been working fine after a regular software update.,pos
An awesome product. Getting my money's worth. I would truly recommend this product.,pos
This was one of my best purchases hundreds of great movies and shows available.,pos
I was quite disappointed when I began working through the menus and discovered that my 2 year old Roku 3 was far more intuitive. Roku also allows searches of all of your subscribed services. If I am already paying a subscription fee to Netflix or HBO NOW and I can watch a tv show or movie without additional cost why should I pay Amazon to watch it? I am a fan of Amazon services and a Prime member but I also don't want to throw my money away. Roku is still the best.,neg
"Nothing really spectacular about this, weird interface. It is okay.",pos
i was not expecting how great this product is. It was really easy to use and install.,pos
When I first purchased an Amazon fire TV box I was a bit skeptical to what I could get from it but being a member of Amazon prime I was quickly satisfied with all the content available so I decided to buy a second one for the bedroom.,pos
So far the best streaming system I have tried. Even better than Appletv.,pos
It does everything that it is suppose to. It does seam to be a little slow over wifi. Does seam to buffer now and then So much faster then my Apple TV! I love it! Netflix loads instantly and very clear!,pos
I found the Fire tv great and I really am satisfied I recommend it to all my friends and family,pos
My wife is always on this thing. She loves it. I have it connected with an ethernet cord and hdmi cable and use an SD card. It works really well for a decent price,pos
It does everything that it is suppose to. It does seam to be a little slow over wifi. Does seam to buffer now and then.,pos
So much faster then my Apple TV! I love it! Netflix loads instantly and very clear!,pos
"Great if you're an Amazon Subscriber. Music, Movies and Alexia to let you know the weather.",pos
This thing is great so much better than the appli tv we got,pos
Some channels still glitchy but overall great hardware.,pos
"I love that this guy supports 4K content since I just recently bought a 4K TV. Please be aware that if you don't already have an Amazon account, you'll have to set one up before using it. You can set it up through the Fire TV, but It'd be best if you just do it through a computer because the process to set up the account through the device I tedious and frustrating at times.",pos
I came in to purchase a different streaming device and the store associate recommended this one instead. Glad I decided to stop in the store instead of paying more for the other device online.,pos
First had the fire stick and i heard the box was much faster. I bought it and as soon as i plugged in and got started i was able to see how fast and smooth it worked. Great product.,pos
This is a great set top box with plenty of apps that will keep anyone engaged for hours!,pos
I got my Amazon FireTV from Best Buy. At that time they were fully stocked as hoped for. The price was great. Best Buy is my store.,pos
"Bought the Fire TV because the remote could be used to control Slingbox, plus being an Amazon Prime member had access to a lot of content. Works great",pos
"If you have prime membership, this is a must-have to maximize the benefits amazon offers to you.",pos
"Originally purchased the fire TV Stick, upgraded for more bandwith and storage, awesome product.",pos
"I recently purchased the Amazon Fire TV for use in a spare room. I subscribe to various platforms including Netflix and Playstation Vue. Although I am on a wireless connection, playback has been smooth, with almost no glitches. Not to mention, the picture quality has been superb (this can vary depending on the bandwidth of your internet connection). Setup was a breeze and it is very intuitive; so much so, that my 9 year old can use it with no problems (and after applying parental controls of course).",pos
I decided to cut back on bills so bought this to stream movies an TV shows. Works great so far as long as my Internet is good.,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is really easy to use and installation was super easy. I have really enjoyed the voice search feature. Best purchase I've made in awhile.,pos
Great product. You can see any type progrant. I will reconment.,pos
"Software can be clunky to navigate. Certain apps are not available at this time for Amazon fire tv, only saving grace is my subscription to Playstation Vue",pos
"Had the fire tv stick for awhile and decided to give that to my parents and get this for me and my wife. Both of us were blown away by the difference between the two. So much faster loading everything. Amazed at how when you choose a video to watch and hit play, its there. instantly. Amazing.",pos
First one had issues from the update that was loaded upon installation. Returned and waited several weeks before buying a replacement. Seems to work better.,pos
I love my fire tv. The only thing I don't like is my remote keep freezing. I have already change the batteries to brand new ones twice and it still freezes. I'm ready to buy a new remote.,pos
for the price of this box you really cant go wrong,pos
"Very valueble product, very easy to use, many features, way better than the stick, wont be disappointed.",pos
"A friend at work mentioned this product and told me that it is pretty decent for movies. I am amazed at just how much content you can access on this fire tv box. If you like to watch tv; movies, cable series and play games you can't go wrong with this purchase.",pos
Setup was going great until the remote stopped working. Replaced batteries several times but did not help. Had to return product.,neg
"This device i exactly what i wanted, also i have purchased the Prime membership with Amazon which is great for ordering Amazon products, that gives free shipping, Movies, Music and TV Shows. Check it out.Definitely recommend it",pos
I really enjoy watching movies on this it's very easy to use and Alexis makes searching a piece of cake,pos
I love using this to stream movies instead of using my old PS3. Great picture quality and pretty fast.,pos
I got it because a frend that really lime it. I had apple tv and still think is better than this,neg
This firestick have made me completely independent from cable tv...,pos
"Love it... is really nice product, and not expensive.",pos
I like the box sometimes it glitches out but it's really easy to troubleshoot.,pos
Compared to the rest this is amazing especially the price.,pos
I bought a sony vue/PlayStation vue product to now watch cable tv. I found the channel guide to load a little slow when using the fire stick. that got me to invest in the faster processor and buy an amazon TV. I use the main TV that use and use the less expensive fire sticks for my other 2 TV's.,pos
Was looking for a 4k streamer and was trying to decide between the Roku 4 or this. I had recently ditched my cable and got Playstation Vue for my programming and this allows shows to stream at 60fps. If you get this I also strongly suggest cutting your cable cord and getting Playstation Vue also because this streams sports better than any of the others,pos
it is nice works fast and good easy to use and looks good too!!!,pos
Such a great product I have no complaints. I broughts this product for my family also and they love it,pos
This is one of the fastest smoothest android boxes.,pos
I can watch tons of stuff in my TV who needs cable now days,pos
This is a great device to have if you dont have cable at home and you need to add a program call Kodi also.,pos
This is a great streaming box. It's is more than I expected.,pos
Fire TV is where it's at in today's world! This little media streaming device fits in the palm of my hand but doesn't lack in the content available to my entertainment needs! No matter which one you subscribe to it's totally worth it! I'm actually thinking about cutting the cord on my cable? I couldn't be happier with this amazing little box!,pos
This download movies fast and quick. You get a good picture when using the fire tv because you have to use your hdmi wire,pos
Works great. Less buffering than Fire TV Stick. Like the voice search on it.,pos
"I got this to use while I travel because you can connect to Wi-Fi that has a webpage for signing in, like pretty much all hotels require. It was awesome for about two weeks. At first it worked fine with my brand new awesome Samsung 4k tv, then a week later the tv didn't even recognize it. Apparently it doesn't pay nice with Samsung. Not a huge deal since I bought it for traveling, then it didn't display correctly on the hotel tv, it was just a tiny piece of the picture and it was jammed into the top corner and the rest black. The next hotel, it looked fine but there wasn't any audio. COME ON. Really stinks.",neg
I was really surprised how easy it was to use and set up. I may be looking to add one in my man cave and bedroom too! Great device,pos
Great device for streaming video. You can side load Kodi and different add-ons to get movies and TV shows for free.,pos
So this is my second fire tv and just like my first one I love this one just as much. My advice is you are debating between the fire stick or the fire tv pay the extra money and get the fire tv.,pos
"It's okay. When hooked up to my tv wirelessly, there seems to be a lot of lag. Seems to work better hard wired.",pos
"At first, I was kind of worried that I would not be able to operate it. But it is so easy to use! I also like the parental controls, so I can control what my children watch. The best part of all though is that I don't have to see any infomercials! My family and myself have definitely enjoyed having this product in our home. We have yet to run out of programs and movies to watch!",pos
"I had the firestick first so I decided to upgrade my new TV with a fireTV and I haven't had any issues it's so easy to use runs way smoother than my firestick, and I love that I can upload storage with my micro SD card.",pos
"Nice product.My kids love it,good for YouTube search.",pos
I am very happy with fire tv. i was even happier went it went on sale a week after I bought it and best buy gave me the diference back.,pos
Install was easy. Only issue was using it with PSVue.,pos
"I bought this strictly for the streaming 4K content from Netflix. Not sure if this happened to others, but season 2 of HOC would never stream correctly in 4K. The other seasons worked just fine. Also, HOC looks very very good just on HD 5.1.",pos
"Worth the purchase, makes watching shows easy plug and play",pos
4K ready looks great very fast... Don't waste your money on the stick get this one,pos
Great for intertainment very good device effective better than cable Tv,pos
"One of the best streaming devices available currently especially for the cost. The app store gives you access to all the major streaming services - Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, etc. The only knock on it is that it places heavy focus on Amazon Prime videos for obvious reason. As a side benefit (pun intended) - you can put SPMC/Kodi/XBMC on it like I have and combined with a HDHOMERUN it is now a cable box replacement. It is the only box I have plugged into my TV and use it for Live TV, DVR, Movies, Videos, Pictures, and all the streaming apps. Powerful little unit that saves on electricity and space compared to HTPC that was hooked up before. No more monthly cable box rental fee's so it pays for itself in a few months.",pos
I have the stick also much better than the stick one...,pos
The best item I have ever seen in my life and so glad I found this item....:),pos
You are streaming over the net so occasionally this will cause some inconvenience but all in all 98% of the time you can utilize this device just as if you had cable or satellite. Time to cut the cord and stopping paying these outlandish supped up prices.,pos
reception and wi fi interface is outstanding much better than roku,pos
I cut the cord with cable and decided to try the Amazon Fire tv and it is amazing. Amazon Fire tv is the only box to offer basically all services. I did a lot of research and I am glad I went with this box!,pos
I hope to use it once I figure out how to use it. I am trying.,neg
There are others streaming devices but they seem to lacking storage or memory,pos
Heard about this through a friend. Was not aware the product even existed. Has really enhanced our time watching TV.,pos
I love my firebox so much I bought one for a friend!!! So much awesomeness with it!!,pos
I love amazon tv products. Takes 5 minutes to install.,pos
This product far exceeded my expectations. I've had no issues thus far in regards to video quality.,pos
"Has a great processor for its size, it's robust with lots of features and has a wonderful small remote that fits nicely in your hand. The remote has much fewer buttons then your standard remotes, which makes its very simply to use and along with Amazon GUI interface makes its simple to get around. I had other products that it competes with and this is by far the best, easier device to get around with.",pos
You needs to have the fire tv to maximize your prime membership,pos
"The box does exactly what it saids it will do. No lag, great quality, very happy!!!",pos
This is the second one I bought and been happy with this purchase. Has everything that Apple has and you can do a lot more with this one.,pos
The size and how easy it is to navigate all the features is a super plus.,pos
"works out of the box, no problems with setup. connects to all the popular streaming apps like hulu amazon prime netflix",pos
"Sure helps in the "" cord cutting"" with the cable company!!",pos
We had no customer support. We returned the item to the store.,neg
I prefer this than anything else out there. It might be because I am partial to Amazon and its service.,pos
"it's got a few glitches in the system but overall, it's so great not having to deal with any cable company. I've got everything I need all in this neat little package.",pos
I could not be happier with this purchase. Lots of entertainment in one small package!,pos
I love this product. easy to ise snd i would recommended to anyone.,pos
Great entertainment. possibilities endless.I love it,pos
My Fire Tv device is very handy and actually have 2 of them and am thinking about getting my 3rd one.,pos
"tried fire stick first ,to slow for me so i exchanged it for this fire tv .. i like it much better",pos
"The Alexa accessory is very accurate and handy for music and searching. Very good options for movies, tv series and children's programming",pos
The Fire Stick and TV is awesome. Fire TV is a lot faster and it has the option of ether net. I love it.,pos
It basically makes any old TV a smart tv. It is also 4K UHD. That is one of the biggest pluses on top of me having Amazon Prime already.,pos
"I was streaming with my Sony Blu-Ray, and only bought this to access HBO Now, but it's turned out to have much more than just that to offer. It's really a fantastic piece of equipment. The Sony has a great number of streaming apps, but the Fire TV has much more, and lots of things I really missed, such as PBS and PBS Kids, as well as access to Amazon's music streaming. I'm very happy that I bought this.",pos
"Of the three streaming boxes i have owned this one is hands down the best. I added Playstation Vue app and now i get 59 cable channels. Prime movies, music, and TV is awesome.",pos
I'm a cable cutter and Amazon Fire TV has been a God send. I have more content now than with cable. Highly recommend this producg.,pos
We decided to cut our cable bill and start using streaming devices instead. The Fire has been great. The only problem is finding time to watch all the stuff we put in our watch list.,pos
Well worth the upgrade from the Amazon Fire stick... It is definately a lot faster and smoother.,pos
Good bye cable! This works great. I wish I would have purchased sooner.,pos
We really enjoy it. Bought it to watch our slingbox but we have found tons of extra content that we really enjoy,pos
"If youre choosing between this and the apple tv , I find this to better as long as you dont plan on connecting things through the cloud.",pos
Since I got a 4k television I purchased this. Its a great little device. I still have an original 1080p version and this one is slightly faster. Great product.,pos
We are super happy with the Amazon Fire. We are using it more than our DirectTv. Quality is good and user friendly.,pos
This box is amazing very fast smooth interface kid friendly at a great price,pos
Out the box this devise works good and plays well with others.,pos
Very fast. Does everything you need it to at a great price.,pos
Bought this to use Play Station Vue to replace Comcast cable. Cheaper and provides all the cable channels we usually watch. Seems to work great - glad I did it!,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is amazing. I highly recommend!,pos
Great little streamer and so much available content,pos
Having this beats paying the high cable and satellite prices.,pos
This is a perfect product for people who use amazon's services.,pos
"Awesome steaming device, compared to the Roku 3 I would give the Amazon Fire TV the edge. Great buy, I would recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about cutting the cord on their cable subscription.",pos
"Has game selections, most my kids play. Great for daily use!",pos
The fire tv has every app that is needed. And it is very easy to install and setup. Probably going to pick up one more!,pos
"All your services in one place. UI takes a little getting used to, but becomes 2nd nature.",pos
Bought this to streaming media in HD and 4K and it works great. Only bad thing is you need a high speed HDMI to be able to streaming in 4k.,pos
"I have a bunch of sticks but to be honest, I like the box better. Runs much faster and less buffering",pos
"We're an unplugged family - multiple devices (Kindles, iPads, Roku, etc.) - so we're pretty familiar with this sort of tech. Fire TV works okay, but the remote has started giving me problems and we've only had the product for about 6 months. Our Roku 3, which we've had for over a year, is much smoother and hasn't given us any problems. We also use a Chromecast, which also seems to be less quirky than the FireTV. I have a PS3 in the same room as the FireTV and I find myself going to the PS3 when the FireTV starts to annoy. Unless you're looking for a device that can also run Kodi, I'd strongly recommend the Roku 3 over the FireTV.",neg
I bought this to utilize playstaion vue to cut my cable. works great,pos
"If you are looking to add smart TV capabilities to your TV (or replace existing smart TV capabilities), this is the product to own! In my opinion Amazon knocked it out of the park with this streamer. Paired with a 4K TV, it adds amazing clarity to 4K Content!",pos
I love my Roku but the Amazon Fire TV is the box to own and the price is right.,pos
If is the easy to set up and use ...Got everything I wanted and more the speed of the tv box is great !!!,pos
Amazing item that everyone in the whole family enjoys.,pos
"This has allowed me to cut that nasty cable cord, which is nice to the check book.",pos
"The box works great it is compact, easy to install and all around easy to navigate. The only reason I did not give the full star rating is that my remote keeps giving out. It will work most the time then it will just stopped I have replaced the batteries. That's not the issue I actually have to take the batteries out and put them back in to some times get the remote working again. I am hoping getting the remote replaced will be easy and hassle free",pos
This is a very good product with good performance and value.,pos
Does exactly what it is supposed to. 5 stars if it were a little less $$ and had bitstream audio out for pos dolby atmos decoding on the receiver end.,pos
Faster and better than any roku or apple tv! Great buy for the price,pos
"I had some trouble after purchasing this, had to reboot it a lot, but since the last update it has been working great.",pos
The Fire TV has a great interface and is very fast.,pos
Great little streaming device. Mainly use for Netflix and Playstation Vue,pos
"This is my second Amazon Fire TV. I like both first and second versions of the AFTV, unless your programming is broadcast in 4K, you won't notice the picture quality of the two versions. It has all the Apps you will need and available to sideload if it's not available thru Amazon. Voice command only works with downloaded Apps. Overall, I like AFTV over 3rd Gen Apple TV....",pos
Very great product very great product very great product,pos
Still the best streaming device for kodi Works flawless,pos
"Amazon Fire tv from Best Buy was my second Fire tv purchase in a week. After trying the tv service, I ordered a 2nd one on line from Best Buy & picked it up in store within an hour. The price matched the 1st one but the HDMI cable was extra. When I am used to using Fire tv, I will turn the cable service off. Amazon's Alexa assistant is phenomenal & for me, is better than Apple's Siri. This was probably the best online purchase & pick up in store experience I have had.",pos
Very happy with this product. I would recommend for anyone,pos
"This is great for the entire family! Love this device to watch shows, movies and even play games!",pos
This product works great for the that we bought it for.,pos
My Amazon TV has two gig in the ram and a quad core processor and it runs great no problems right now only owned it for six weeks right now but it's good,pos
"Better than the firestick, works well with prime and simple to use.",pos
"The Amazon Fire TV box is probably the best streaming box out there. It has a hardwired Ethernet connection if you need it and a fast processor. It has Alexa for voice searches and it supports just about every streaming service out there plus a built-in Slingbox client. Most other streamers that support slingbox are actually screencasting from a smartphone or tablet. Plus it is very easy to sideload applications so you can run about anything. We have crowded building with a lot of WiFi signals stepping on each other, so the hardwired connection is good for reliable streaming. It has Bluetooth, so you can pair devices with it, I think the remote is actually Bluetooth too, so you can stash the box out of sight.",pos
Great product for online streaming. Way better than cable,pos
This product works great. It was very easy to. Setup and get an account going I would recommend the fire tv to everyone that wants to cut the cord from cable. It was cheaper to purchase it at Best Buy then it was on Amazon,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is an excellent alternative to cable and satellite prison. The amount of content available is staggering. The unit functions flawlessly.,pos
Great gift for family and friends. I would recommend to my friends.,pos
"I love my Amazon fire tv!! Use it with Playstation Vue, perfect device to cut the cord!!",pos
I purchased this in order to stream Playstation Vue. It works very well for this. Amazon also offers 4K content - one of the few places you can get it for now.,pos
"Amazon Fire tv is the best ""smart tv box"" available. The box is now 4K video capable and uses the android operating system. Plenty of apps already installed and tons more available. Setup was simple and the menus are a breeze to navigate, especially with voice search.",pos
"Able to watch so many movies, Netflix and get access to more than just the normal cable offsprings.",pos
I purchased this item to cancel my cable tv and use PlayStation Vue for the television channels like SyFy and others. The network connection allows the use the high speed internet without bogging done the Wifi. The only issue I have encountered is the remote can be laggy but it has less lag that the fire tv stick remotes.,pos
"Works well, gives a to of additional options for home television entertainment for everyone.",pos
This was a nice edition to my entertainment add ons. Makes watching tv more of a pleasure. The price wasn't that bad either.,pos
I'm love my fire tv great app to download for movie and tv,pos
I do not use my Apple tvs anymore. Great for PS Vue and Prime.,pos
so much to watch at your leisure when and how you choose.. and its much cheaper than over priced cable or static satellite. . this is definitely the future of watching television..,neg
It was easy to set up. It is even easier to use. And I love all the free movies !!!!,pos
Great product for the money. My family and I are enjoying it.,pos
"Great dealing with Best Buy. They are always helpful when I ask questions, and honor all promises.",pos
"To be honest, I think the Fire TV is a way better investment than Apple TV. Highly recommended!",pos
"I got this because I didn't want to set another cable box in my room. I don't watch a lot of tv to begin with. What I like about the fire tv is that you can download apps such as the Uverse app from att and watch live tv from it. And other apps like history channel, Netflix, food channel. You can also buy an app that lets you connect your smart phone to the tv. So if you have a movie on your phone or laptop that the fire tv doesn't have, you can connect it and mirror it and it will appear on your tv. Almost as having a cable box but you only pay once and not every month for it. The control does get disconnected a lot, I don't know if it's the Amazon batteries or if it's the remote. Over its good for someone who doesn't watch a lot of tv.",pos
Easy to setup and use. The content is very clear. Connect to wireless or Ethernet and off to the races.,pos
Absolutely worth the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,pos
Simple and easy to navigate. Smooth screen with no buffering.,pos
"This box has it all! Does 4K and also has a super fast Quad Core Processor. Has great WIFI AC, and also has the Ethernet plug in. Great Streaming machine, but the best thing about it is the PRICE!",pos
We don't have cable at our home... We use this and it's great and saves us lots of money.,pos
I haven't used it yet because it is attached to my other tv set. but I'm sure i will be please with my purchase.,pos
"Is very good, I like, I recommend this product, I recommend, I recommend",pos
This device is easy to install and great for a beginner!,pos
"Great product that is easy to install and setup. It does not come with an HDMI cable so be sure to have one handy. On a side note, your email with get spam continuously with Amazon Advertisement to be sure to unsubscribe as soon as you can.",pos
We are happy with purchasing the Amazon Fire. Very easy to use and don't know what we watched without it.,pos
"Amazon Fire TV is so much better than cable or satellite TV. If you have a good internet connection, this is the best!",pos
Cut the cord with DirecTV and so happy that I did. Lots of content to watch and crystal clear. Quality Streaming & Sound. Thanks Bezos.,pos
"Happy The Fire TV, Have had no issues, Like another way to use Alexa.",pos
Had bought 2 Fire sticks and decided to get the fire tv box to get more space to download movies and games.,pos
Gives access to all streaming apps & doesn't seem too slow as far as responsiveness. Much better than the AF Stick. Haven't had any issues.,pos
Apple TV is going to do better than it currently is to keep up with Amazon Fire. So much more freedom with this little black box.,pos
"I own a Chromecast and didn't think I would need this. How wrong I was! The Amazon Fire TV box is more functional and useful than the Chromecast. It is easy to travel with and as long as you have a solid Internet connection (wired or wireless), you can enjoy this device. This was a great purchase and I highly recommend it! So nice I bought it twice!",pos
it is not free everything . have to pay and had return it to best buy store . wish free everything without cents . sorry,neg
everyone in the family can use it and find something they want to watch or do on this,pos
Easy to use and no buffering issues. Works better on wifi than cable,pos
This is my third one I have in my house. We love the ease of use and compatibility with all our online services. Works great. Never had an issue with any of them.,pos
I originally purchased the Amazon fire stick which I did not like at all! it was very slow and it didn't stream Netflix well. I returned the fire stick in exchange for the Amazon fire TV and holy cow what a difference. Everything streams so quickly and it works tremendously well with Wi-Fi. Only bad thing is you have to restart it from time to time to refresh the system.,pos
Since purchasing this product I rarely ever watch live tv anymore. It does exactly what I wanted it to.,pos
"ask yourself if you want a chromcast for 1/3 the cost of this device or do you want to up to PS4 and pretty much get all the features this has and a gaming platform. Then again, you can tweak this system with after market software which you can't on the other two. If you like amazon, are on a budget and have prime, might as well go deeper into the amazon ecosphere.",pos
I love everything about my fire tv. I wish I wouldve gotten one sooner!,pos
"Totally love this product, definitely makes time pass by faster and can take it anywhere",pos
"This will be your simple answer: yes, this will fulfill ALL of your cable cutting desires.I purchased this product after reading several reviews online, researching the specifications between this Amazon Fire TV and the Fire Stick (and their respective generations), and I planned my attack on making sure I fully cut away from the monopoly that is Cable/Satellite television today.Wow, not only did this completely replace my cable subscription with a company that rhymes with AP&P, but I was welcomed into an entirely new world of entertainment once I had this device up and running the way I wanted to. Which, by the way, the setup and installation is an absolute breeze, no need for installation manuals, guides, etc.Buy this, cut away from your overpriced cable, and get to entertaining yourself right now!",pos
The 4k is pretty nice and they response time is nice. Wife uses this mostly. Haven't heard any negative comments yet. Got it to use for PlayStation vue.,pos
Great for people that are not real tech savy easy to use...your,pos
I use the device to watch movie and my son watch YouTube on for his alphabet,pos
Good product much faster response then a fire stick,pos
I'm really enjoying my Amazon FireTv. It's everything I though it would be.,pos
I love the Fire TV Box it works flawlessly. I recommend adding the Spotify App. It makes all your sorround sound Bluetooth. Worth every penny for sure . Don't think about it just buy it .,pos
"The product works well except the WiFi drops every so often. Restart the firetv and it's fine. Also, the remote will sometimes not work. Pull batteries and put them back in fixes it. Kind of sad for such problems cuz I love the firetv.",pos
I would recommend it to all my family very happy with this item.,pos
"Everything I had read was a bit confusing on how the Echo can control it.. but low and behold it has the Alexa service built into it. The Echo CANNOT control the Amazon Fire TV which was the sole reason I bought it. Well.. also in hopes that HBO Now would have Surround Sound on it, but of course it didn't. So they're both at fault here and the reason why I returned it immediately. Since neither of the above worked, this made the device completely redundant with my Chromecast.",neg
Installed the Kodi program on this & it works better then Netflix - I get to watch the latest shows for FREE.,pos
I used to have the first generation of Fire TV. Love it. This is the 2nd generation and 4 k ready. Even better,pos
Love this.. Would buy so many times if I had more tvs,pos
Easy to set up had all the channels I felt it was less clunky than roku,pos
"I have used several different streaming players/devices including the Amazon Fire TV stick and others like the Google Chromecast. I liked the Fire TV sticks but I am basically impressed with the Fire TV unit. The extra connections and microSd slot are a big plus. I also really like the voice remote. I have Kodi TV installed as well and it makes playing videos/music and viewing pictures via my home network incredibly easy. The interface is also nice looking. Overall, I am very pleased with the unit. I bought one for my 4K TV and it streams 4K content very well. It only goes to 4K mode when the UHD stream is actually playing though and stays at full HD most of the time. I liked it enough that I bought another one of my home theater room as well. I definitely recommend these units to others.",pos
"I had the Fire Stick prior to purchasing the Fire TV and it is night and day. Fire TV is much faster and has larger buffer, there is no lag in response time while watching TV thru Fire TV. Very happy with this purchase.",pos
"it is a great streaming device with all the apps you need for streaming whatever it is you watch, cut the cable go to streaming it will save a lot of money",pos
Excellent except for the fact that after it automatically goes into sleep mode after thirty minutes of non-activity it is difficult to wake up.,pos
This item is the worst ever a d the tech support is even worst. Spent hour troubleshooting and their solution was to return it to Bestbuy a d get anotherone. So i did. And guess what? It didn't work ether. Basically the Netflix app can't be downloaded becuse the Amazon Fire tv won't let you and to make it worst if you're a fan of HBO brace yourself becuase the app isn't even available on their app store. HBO simply doesn't exist. I spent in total 4 days troubleshooting with the Amazon team actually managing the Fire TV remotely from their offices and the answer was that ether the equipment is defective or that they don't have Netflix or HBO available for it. REALLY ITS FREAKING ADVERTISED ON THE BOX. DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY. better get an apple tv or a roku,neg
Best feature I like is that it plays in 4K.Apple tv does not,pos
It is very kid friendly. It was very easy to use at home.,pos
"Very easy to set up and operate. The voice command is especially nice when playing music and so far I've found the music library to be quite large with a good selection. If you use Amazon at all I would recommend the Prime membership as it pays for itself quickly and drastically increases the available content in the media libraries. No, I'm not an Amazon employee :)",pos
"After purchasing a smart tv looking forward to using the built in apps I discovered that the ones offered weren't up to par. I went back and talked to a very knowledgeable associate, Heather, she showed me why i was having trouble with the streaming on my new tv and suggested getting a streaming device. After listening to her explain the differences between them I decided on the Amazon Fire TV and she was spot on. No more issues and the speed and picture are great. Thanks so much Heather.",pos
"Very Fast, Excellent Quality. The most I like is Alexa! You can ask whatever you want and she will respond",pos
"Streaming box that does the job, I can access My Prime videos and other streaming apps, good device for a good price, worth the money.",pos
The tv has the same functionality as my stick. The program choices are excellent.,pos
This is a great little android box. Already had one but when I found out it was on sale I bought another. Just sideload kodi onto it and it has everything you need. Wired connection to the internet is a must for streaming HD content.,pos
Remote is just the right size and it gives you an instant response.,pos
"We love our amazon Fire TV's, this is our second one and we use them with netflix and hulu and our amazon prime video accounts, they work fantastically and we decided to stop paying for cable as theres usually nothing good on when we want to watch t.v. anyway!",pos
It's small and fairly open platform with wide array of third party services,pos
"This is my second Amazon Fire TV and I absolutely love it! Works great for streaming Amazon Prime shows/movies, Netflix, Hulu, and HBO GO. I don't have cable and with all of those programs I save money and get all the entertainment I want.",pos
"We debated on getting this because we already have an xbox one for streaming. However, this device streams seamlessly. The remote makes finding shows simple.",pos
"The better choice from the others, especially if you are a Prime member. Easy to set up and to use. Voice remote and now with Alexa built in, the better choice",pos
I think it's a awesome device if you like tok stream.,pos
The set up was easy and fast. Just plug and play. You even get one month of free service.,pos
Was so glad to get rid of my cable bill for TV. There are a lot of free stuff out there that this will save me a ton.,pos
"Works well. It was easy to set up. My only complaint is that it's a hassle to load applications that don't come with it. I loaded Xfinity to go on it, and it was very difficult to use, as it doesn't fit the screen right. Great idea, too many glitches with new software. I would recommend getting a mini bluetooth keyboard. It was easy to connect, and works well with this.",pos
Works well. Like that Android apps can be sideloaded onto the device. Easy to set-up and use.,pos
No issues works as good as ur internet... No buffering,pos
Love it this is so much better then paying for cable TV there's so much to see you can see and even have to pay extra for it to view movies,pos
Easy set up. 4K ready. Great picture and WiFi connectivity,pos
It's has all of the best services and now with Alexa and 4K it's even better,pos
Save some $$ for hight price cable tv!!! This is the reason why i cancelled my cable tv,pos
"Easy to use, fantastic product plethora of movies, games, and always new content being added",pos
Heard about this from a friend. Best Buy answered all my questions. Enjoy the product,pos
"Much faster than the stick in every way (wifi, processor, and ram). I like this a lot more than the stick it's just snappier.The voice remote is useless. I still prefer the Apple TV 4, over AFTV.",pos
"Everything is good, but no youtube good amount of apps",pos
Very easy to set up and to use. I have not used the voice control yet but will soon,pos
It works great. Awesome device. A great way to ditch your cable service provider.,pos
"Great product. I purchased it for its Playstation Vue and HBO Now streaming capabilities, as well as its ability to stream 4k programming. Nice if paired with an Amazon Prime subscription.",pos
"Fire TV is good except I have to reboot it more than should be necessary. It drops its network connection too often. Rather than reentering my password, I find it easier to just unplug it for a few seconds. Once, the remote became unresponsive . The fix: remove the batteries then put them right back in. Updates should correct these matters.",pos
Love it it works wonders great job greate product.will recommend to any friend,pos
"Overall I like the fire TV.The UI could be a better,it could be better organized and easier to navigate.It also pushes Amazon video over other streaming services.Doesn't have as many streaming services as Roku.",pos
"I'm glad I bought this, it's super fast, faster than the stick and the picture quality is amazing.",pos
when you turn on fire box it opens/runs movies fast.,pos
I absolutely love my fire tv. it works so well and offers so many different things to watch. I will never need cable again. it loads fast and I would recommend these to anyone who will listen!,pos
"I found this device was easy to hook up, also easy to navagate perfect box for beginners and advanced users",pos
Bought this device to stream movies and shows online!,pos
"Love Fire TV. I have since cut cable, with the exception of my internet connection, and have no regrets. I get more channels through streaming media apps. and at cheaper prices. The menu is also user friendly. The remote is excellent, as is the voice commands options. You won't regret purchasing Fire TV.",pos
"This is a great product, but I think I could've gotten the Fire Stick. Maybe someday I'll use it for what it's worth. But none the less, a great product.",pos
If you are a Amazon prime member it's a must have even if your not you will love this I got the 4 k one could not be happier,pos
Great product from Amazon that does not fail. Package well!,pos
This the best streaming device out there. If your looking for a great and fast streaming device this it it for sure. You can't go wrong with it. Super fast and no buffering,pos
Great product was able to use my sling account and access all my Amazon shows was also user friendly very happy worth the cash especially now in 4k,pos
This is an excellent product. I bought mine when it was on sale for $84.99. It was a great investment.,pos
A great addition to this product is to add Kodi for all your movie and television show needs,pos
Very easy to use. A high quality apple product. Good tech!,pos
"I've been using both Roku (embedded into LG TV) and the Amazon Fire Tv. The pos winner is the Amazon Fire TV since it always works, very fast, as expected, no issues, no bugs. The Roku instead is slower (takes time to react and load content). I mainly use Netflix and YouTube. Amazon Fire TV delivers outstanding menu navigation and fast response while searching/navigating through content (movies, tv shows, videos). Also Amazon Fire TV is always on and ready and you can take advantage of Alexa to use your voice to command (useful from time to time).",pos
This box works great. It sure would be nice if it had the Google play store on it.,pos
"I am very pleased with Amazon Fire TV, I see my films, my children play games and watch channels",pos
User friendly and gives me access to all my streaming services.,pos
"Originally bought the fire stick, worked but not nearly as good as this. Worth the extra money.",pos
Amazon TV is on par with Apple TV. I especially like toe original programming that Amazon offers.,pos
This is a great product for watching movies especially if you're tired of paying those high cable prices.,pos
"If you are planning on buying a amazon fire stick, reconsider and buy the fire tv. Far superior, better display and faster processor.",pos
loved the voice search easy to install and very easy to use,pos
Works great & it doesn't freeze. Happy I bought it. Works better than the fire stick,pos
I love my amazon fire tv. I canceled my directv and replaced it with the fire tv. I saved $165.00/ month.,pos
I added to my gift card that I got for getting my iPhone SE . I already had a fire stick so I decided to try the fire tv . It has a lot less buffering than the fire stick . It also seems to operate easier and has a little more to offer than the fire stick,pos
Using this with Playstation Vue for TV and HBO Now. It works great!,pos
"love this firetv. i have an amazon account, but i installed and subscribe to PlaystationVue to get channels i used to pay comcast for - WAY cheaper. easy product to setup and use- definitely worth the $$ to be able to dump cable tv!!",pos
"Amazon Fire TV is amazing, lots of free channels and old and new movies you can even watch Netflix for free. We will be ditching satellite dish and saving $160 per month. In addition we will be adding Amazon Fire sticks to other TV's through out our home. Product is very easy to use.",pos
Great purchase. quick speed lots of choices to watch and cheap !,pos
"I've tried Apple TV, chromecast, original fire stick and I love this one the best. Easy to use and setup, voice search is nice. Much better if you have add on products like Netflix Hulu or kodi. Only beef is the poor content selection from Amazon.",pos
"Out of the box this is a very capable media streaming device able to stream from most all of the popular media streaming services, but once Kodi is side-loaded and configured it is unstoppable!",pos
"I love it, It is by far way better than Apple TV and Chromecast!",pos
This is a wonderful product that can be used by everyone,pos
Compared these headphones to beats. Satisfied with the purchase!,pos
Very good product. I really enjoy it. Easy to use.,pos
The Amazon Fire tv is awesome. It works so much better than my Apple TV and I am a huge Apple fan,pos
Amazon Fire Tv was quick and easy to set up. After signing in with my prime account my son was able to watch a bunch of shows and movies!,pos
Easy to setup and use. Tons of apps and games to choose from.,pos
Good overall android box quick and easy to operate,pos
My previous experience with Amazon stick was awful but after returning that I tried this product and was way better.,pos
"good for android and very fast, good for gaming and streaming",pos
"For the price, it is so worth it! We have about 6 devices on our wifi and this is the fastest one out of the bunch! Lightning speeds and no wait time to download anything. You get movies, tv shows, music, NETFLIX!...Get Amazon prime too! So worth it!",pos
"Overall, this product works great on non-smart tvs; very easy to install.",pos
This device works well and however there is no clear way to tell what programming is free with subscription or what requires a fee.,pos
Perfect gift. My family love it! Have one in each of the rooms.,pos
The set up and installation were easy to do. The quality of the products is great.,pos
"It's a fantastic device.Really fast, super quite and I never have any issues with the remote staying paired like I did with my NVIDIA shield. So I highly recommend this device!",pos
I used this player for Netfis andl streaming movies.,pos
I've come from using a Roku and also a Nexus Player and this Amazon Fire TV blows the doors off of them. I do like the newer Roku 4 but you can't beat the price and features that this one has. I definitely recommend this one.,pos
I was amazed everything I could do with this Amazon Fire TV! Loved the relibility and ease of use. Plus with the RF remote I can hide this behind my TV.,pos
"Excellent performance, Alexa really performs, outperforms apple and roku.",pos
Originally bought TV Stick and ran into a few issues. Returned for Fire TV and I am not disappointed at all.,pos
it is worth the price! easy to use and user friendly.,pos
"Amazing box I love everything it offers, this is perfect for everything you are looking to stream live for :)",pos
works well with no problems and I am happy with my purchase,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is a superb streaming device! It is by far the best streaming device I have ever owned!,pos
I got this unit to stream Netflix and to watch YouTube contents. It works fast and like the fact that it has a Ethernet port.,pos
Love it with the remote. Smooth interface too. Huge plus if you have Amazon prime,pos
I had a firestick but broke it so I upgraded to the fire box. I love it,pos
Is Great product. Easy to set up. Worked instantly.,pos
Well worth the money. I found the Fire tv great and I really am satisfied I recommend it to all my friends and family,pos
Best way to cut the cord. Saved me over 150 dollars a month!!,pos
"great price for a lot of fun. this is my 3rd amazon fire, great for games, movies. I installed kodi on it for extra programing and life tv. I loved my amazon fire TV.",pos
I can watch anything any time my daughter likes it .,pos
Works excellent...............................................,pos
Great little streamer. Little to no buffering for amazon prime. Easy to load Kodi for expanded fealtures.,pos
Great product .I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.,pos
Great device can watch anything without cable box!,pos
"This device is perfect for converting that ""dumb"" TV in your home to a ""smart"" one. Also, perfect for that TV that has limited apps. This comes with everything!",pos
"Decided to spend the extra money to get the model with more processing power for games. Other than the occasional heating up and the unit freezing, it serves its purpose",pos
"It works well with the Apps, easy to connect to the internet",pos
I chose this product over the fire stick because it's hardwired to my Internet box give great speed without buffering I would recommend this if your router or modem is nearby w I chose this product over the fire stick because is hardwired to my Internet box give great speed without buffering I would recommend this if your router or modem is nearby your unit.,pos
The box works great it was a great buy. I'm able to watch some great movies,pos
Easy to use. No technical issues whatsoever. Great value for the money,pos
This keyboard does it all for the beginner or for the professional. The keys have a real piano feel with some resistance. The speakers are amazing. The choice of instrument sounds are outstanding and the tone of those instruments are right on.,pos
I started our with just the Fire Stick at home. Once I purchased a 4k TV I decided to splurge on the Fire TV. I'm so glad I did the one thing that annoyed me about the stick was relying on WiFi stability and now I've ran an ether net straight to my router so problem solved.,pos
"Great product.i can stream almost anything.Netflix Hulu, you name it.this product is the best.",pos
"Amazon makes an amazing product that turns any tv into a smart TV. Slim, sleek and extremely easy to install and use.",pos
This Amazon Fire TV works great with my apps to see other providers,pos
All the shows and one third of the price of cable.,pos
Connected to WiFi with no issues. Streaming is smooth and error free. Good alternative and being an Amazon Prime member a lot of things are free.,pos
Serves the purpose well specially if one has an older non-smart tv. However there is always additional expenses because most of the features you have to subscribe to and pay for,pos
i have the firestick in our bedroom and this in the living room. works great very fast. for the price its well worth it.,pos
"Loads of apps available, Netflix , PlayStation vue, Hulu , etc. very useful to setup in a basement with no cable outlet.",pos
"Although I had a Roku three that did most of what I needed, Playstation Vue isn't available but it is available on the Fire TV. If you have a prime membership, this is probably for you. If you are one of the people that don't like me, this is nothing but a way for amazon to get you to buy more stuff from them. You can't set the menu's to only show the content that you own and the apps that you have downloaded can't be put first on the list.",neg
Enjoy the small device as well the many features it offers. Will have to get use to the remote but otherwise okay. Price arrange also okay by it being an Apple's product.,pos
4k quality is great! The Alexa ffeature works awesome!!,pos
"Use this everyday, everyone will find it convenient and useful. Great purchase and highly recommend!",pos
"Fast,reliable, and has everything you need!!! Use Kodi for free everything you'll want to get rid of cable/satellite ASAP",pos
the product is great for 4k tvs and normal tvs for the price its pretty good,pos
much faster and stable than the fire tv stick... definitely worth the upgrade,pos
It was a great product but I purchased it for the Slingbox app. Last week it just stopped working on all my Amazon Fire Sticks and Fire TV. They say they are working on it but it has been about a week with no resolution. I am not the only one with this issue it seems to affect them all. Before that it worked very well. Better than expected. Not sure if they are going to get this fixed or not. If they get his fixed I would rate it a 4 to 5.,neg
Great product worth the money to pickup one of these models,pos
This is the best device for watching Netflix content.,pos
"I use this for PS Vue and works great. Knocking a star due to ethernet issues, and for some reason ESPN app keeps dropping the connection.",pos
It was easy and simple to use. Fast and responsive.,pos
This is a great streaming device. Definitely worth the extra cost compared to the fire stick. Apps open instantly and operates flawlessly.,pos
I like to use it for movies and a lot of tv programs.,pos
Researched this ahead of time and pleased so far. Good processing speed and no issues streaming. Got this specifically to get PlayStation Vue.,pos
Great box and fast for steaming and videos good for sports,pos
"If you haven't bought one of these already, I suggest you do so. You won't be disappointed.",pos
I purchased the FireTV to integrate into my Control4 system as a media streaming device. It has worked flawlessly in the mode. I'm still getting used to the controls but they seem pretty straight forward.,pos
We like the Fire better than Roku. We also prefer the ease of use over the funtionality of our new Sony 4K TV.,pos
Excellent product. Good Price and a good buy for the entertainment.Will recommend to others.,pos
"Tried IP controlling with a Control4 system, response was slow with button presses. Video quality seems better on Appletv",neg
"Perfect for PS Vue and HBO Now. Had it for over a month now, no issues!",pos
Took some getting use to but finally got it set up and love it.,pos
This works perfect for what I need it for. Great addition.,pos
"This replaced my dish/cable. Soooo many apps to choose from. Speaking into the remote is a HUGE plus. Ease of use is 2nd to none. I also bought a fruit TV, and this is hands down better.",pos
Love this. Had one for the living room had to get one for the bedroom.,pos
"Works good, but a little cluttered display, I prefer the Roku",pos
This product is great my family love it. We would recommend this to anyone,pos
Work good with my internet. Have basic cable and use this to watch movies and steam tv shows.,pos
It is a great unit to watch movies and tv and it is very portable,pos
"I have been very hesitant of cutting that cable cord, but I decided to buy the Amazon Fire TV and test it out. I cut the cable cord the next day. Well worth the purchase and the savings from not having cable tv.",pos
What else can I say about this product other than it is truly fun and amazing. We spend hours finding new things to watch,pos
"I was looking for ways to cut cost from a raising cable bill and a friend suggested I try the Amazon Fire. At first I didn’t know if this was something I could do. Once I was able to maneuver through the process, I love it.",pos
Works very well. Easy to use and Straightforward.Would recommend it to anyone.,pos
Best Streamer. I use it for sony vue and to works great. This my 3rd Amazon Tv.,pos
"This is my second one purchased, what else can I say. Thanks BestBuy",pos
This item is the best for your buck! This item hands down won't let you down!,pos
Best 100 bucks I've ever spent. Definitely recommend it.,pos
So far I am loving this still learning all the in and out,pos
"The Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) works really well, the only negative thing is my remote stopped working after the first day, but I downloaded the app on my phone and it works really well., I have the box behind my tv, and have no problem controlling it with my phone.",pos
Very easy to use and more reliable than cable tv. After set up by a friend it's all I use.,pos
Very useful products. I like very much . Perfect side . Very easy to navigate into,pos
Decided to ditch cable and after my research decided to buy 2 of these. Installed PSVue on it for cable channels and don't have to pay equipment fees to the cable company anymore.,pos
Bought this so I can have 4k from Playstation Vue to my new Samsung 4k tv,pos
We bought this for my father's tv. He is so happy with it! He can easily navigate throught all the apps and play what he wants! I can only say this product works really good!,pos
This device is good for people trying to reduce their cable bill.,pos
This is great for streaming Plex to tv's. No hassle perfect quality for a fire stick,pos
This smart box does exactly what it says it does. I like that it adds the pics and videos from my cell phone in an easy to use app.,pos
"This is a great product. I downloaded tv apps like directv, HBO go, tnt, ESPN, etc. then I take it where ever I go, as long as I can get wifi, I won't miss a show or a movie. Fire stick is a little more travel friendly but this is faster between clicking on screens and had more internal memory (with option to add sdhc card)",pos
We have both apple and Amazon. The Amazon has many more features and apps than Apple.,pos
I'm loving it. I've got it for 2 months now and im very happy with it. It feels very fast and reliable. Also the interface feels very friendly and easy to use.,pos
love the item. many features and variety of options. recent and old programs and movies. i can now look at a whole series at once.,pos
I love my amazon fire HD tv box. This thing is the wave of the future. The 4k content looks amazing.,pos
If you've an Amazon prime account this is a must have. Lots of free shows and movies to watch and lots of apps to download. Also a great way to have tv in another room without the need for another cable or satellite box because it runs off your wifi. Very small so it helps in keeping a nice clean entertaining alternative.,pos
"Look no Further, fast processor, great ram , expandable storage turn your tv into a smart tv",pos
i brought this for my house and i love this fire tv! i can watch just all sort of internet things on it! best thing i have brought in a long time for TV.,pos
"For the same price as the Roku 3, you can get the Amazon Fire TV box. Why would you want this? 1. It runs Android2. You can install Android Apps (via sideload)3. It's Extensible. Because of items 1 and 2, you can really make this any kind of device you want. Most Android apps should work on this, and of course, you have access to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc.",pos
"I enjoy moving night, and it kept becoming a hassle deciding what movies to watch, or what medium I would need to rent them. With the firestick, you have all the movies and shows at your disposal, which makes my life so much easier. What a great find. I am glad word of mouth helped me find this product, and would recommend it to anyone.",pos
"It's a great delivery vehicle for all your Amazon video and music needs. I bought it to watch PlayStation Vue (no more expensive Time Warner Cable for me!) It's built on Android OS so you can install Andriod apps. What I love about this box is that I can load my old school NES and SNES emulators and play them with the Bluetooth controller. You can also set up Kodi on it and you've got all kinds of movie, TV, music and gaming options using it. With micro SD card support and an extra USB port, this device is so much better than the TV Stick, and it's a lot speedier. Highly recommended!",pos
"Great product clear video stream, very easy to hook up",pos
The new Fire TV has every streaming option that you can think of except VUDU. This is the only negative that we have found because we have over 100 digital copies of movies that have been either purchased or came with the blue-ray when we bought them. It is very convenient to not have to use the disc when we want to watch a movie. The Fire TV loses that convenience in that Amazon wants you to use their Prime service for digital movies. If you are going to subscribe to Amazon Prime then look no further than the Fire TV. If you have a large digital movie collection then I'd look to the Roku 4.,pos
This is the 5th or 6th Fire TV I have purchased. Now I have them in every room and have completely cancelled cable. Just pay $60 a month for internet now and use my Fire TV's with the Zeus TV Box program downloaded. Now I get all the movies and tv shows I want for free. And the Fire TV has super fast download speeds. Will be buying more for the family this year.,pos
"This is pretty cool! It has a good variety of options to work with and games, which is even better! Haha!",pos
Fire tv works great except for sometimes has issues connecting and staying connected to wifi.,pos
"Great item, fun for the whole family. Great way to save money",pos
Bought this box and love it. Cut cable and use this with PlayStation Vue. I recommend this over Roku,pos
Great product and easy to set up. I have recommended it to others that have seen it in action.,pos
"Great for streaming, TV shows! Highly recommend this product!",pos
Love the Fire box! Saves us tons on TV. Love all the Apps.,pos
I love this more than my Apple TV. It works well with plex and its all I need.,pos
Pretty comparable to the other streaming devices I own other than the obvious Amazon geared menu.,pos
My family told me about me about this Amazon product as they cut the cable cord. Excellent and highly recommended.,pos
"Did a good bit of research for the fire tv. Bought the stick first, had several operating issues. Unit would buffer then freeze up. The unit got real hot. Returned the stick for the fire tv box. Have not had any of the same problems. Saving over $100 a month cutting out cable. So paid for itself, definitely a great decision.",pos
I purchased this for my father. He likes to watch movies and this was the best way for me to send him movies because he Ives out of town. Great product!!!,pos
Like the fact that this unit now includes Alexa. Hope that more Apps are available soon (seems Roku has a few that this one doesn't).,pos
"Our family enjoys our Amazon tv box, it's great expecially with the free movies and TV shows. I like the remote design better than the apple tv box, but that's just my opinion. It's a great addition to any tv because it makes searching and watching whatever you want effortless.",pos
We first purchased the stick and worked great but we wanted something more powerful. This allowed us to connect directly to our router and got great connection. No more pauses or buffering. I would buy again if I needed to.,pos
This makes tv more fun easy setup just plug and play.,pos
I use this everyday. It's a great buy. Everything you need is ready to go as soon as it turned on.,pos
This product is our first of its kind to own. It has a lot of entertainment optikns.,pos
"I have a Chromecast and Apple TV, but have not used them since I bought this device. An absolute must - especially if you have Amazon Prime!",pos
The amazon fire tv is amazing. Small portable yet powerful and good quality. It is also structured well so things are easy to find.,pos
The Fire TV is an awesome device. Great for Netflix and Hulu streaming.,pos
I'm happy with the latest edition of the Amazon Fire TV. Uses Amazon's digital services seamlessly and has good app support.,pos
"We love the fire tv, all the channels we get not to mention the saving from not needing cable any more.",pos
"It works well when I use it everyday. However, it does not turn on when I do not use it for a few days. I pull out its power code and then it works again. I am not sure if I better to ask to replace it.",pos
The Amazon fire tv is plug and play. Very easy to use,pos
"Great, love it lots of fun and great movies and speed.",pos
This a great product for everyone. I would recommend it,pos
"Canceled my cable and got one of these. Steams netflix, hulu, amazon prime and anything else you need great.",pos
This thing has everything you need to watch movies and shows in 4K. I watch it almost everyday.,pos
I own both a Amazon Fire TV and Fire Stick. The Amazon Fire TV is by far superior than the Fire Stick. The Fire TV is perfect for all-in-one entertainment and perfect if you're looking to get rid of cable/satellite tv. Also very ideal for Kodi,pos
"The Fire Tv is fast and reliable. With the ease of setup and expandability of this product, it's a no brainer BUY!",pos
We enjoy using the fire tv. Since we are prime members we also get free movies,pos
Good device.. Easy to set up. You could stream anything u want basically,pos
"I couldn't be happier with Amazon Fire TV! I had purchased the Fire stick first to try out. It, as well as Fire TV, are a breeze to install...fast, easy, and amazing. I have the voice remotes on all of them and it makes navigating outstanding. I'm using the Fire Stick on my bedroom TV and the Fire TV on my flat screen in the family room. The main difference is that the Fire TV has a greater memory capacity than the Stick. It comes with a lot of free films, programs, games (unlike the other streaming services), music for Prime members. The options available to kids (from toddlers to grade schoolers), are incredible and include both games and videos. It allows you to keep a personal ""Watchlist"" for those things that are you faves or that you want to come back to at a later date. There's so much available with this that I can't say enough about it. It also has all the subscription services that you can test with the free trials that they offer: Sling, Hulu, HBO, Starz, and much, much more. That way, if you're really looking to cut the cable, you get a great feel as to what's out there and how much it will cost should you pick a paid service. Even if you just stick with what Amazon offers freely (and they add things all the time) you still would only be paying for the Fire TV and nothing more. Definitely a win/win for those who are fed up with being gouged over and over by digital services. With this, all you'll need is wifi, and a TV with HDMI ports....and you'll be good to go.",pos
"Love it , so easy to use and you can easily just talk to the control",pos
It's very fast and it's very well made I really like the style of the box it's not bulky like the other boxes out there,pos
The fire tv box simply does it all. Very fast and fun to use,pos
I love my fire TV. I use it mainly for watching movies and TV shows. We also use it for Pandora listening to music. You can also side load applications that aren't available directly through the App Store. I cut the cable cord and haven't looked back!,pos
"the fire tv box is very very fast and has all the TV streaming apps you need to ""cut the cord"". Other streamers like apple tv or roku are not as fast or have all the apps i like. Just avoid the fire tv stick...too slow.",pos
Great streaming device based on Android which makes it somewhat customizable.,pos
Great item for watching all new and old movies and or tv shows.,pos
Awesome products friendly staff would defiantly do business again,pos
"Love it!!! works very well.. I already had amazon prime service and was loving it for fast delivery and no shipping charges... Now, i am getting more bonus out of Prime for using Fire TV!!! works great. some of apps do not work very well. but, that's the app. most of app works fine. I am sure people will continue to fall in love with amazon TV and App will continue to improve.",pos
"My son was the first in the family to buy it. Then he introduced it to me, to his sisters and now we all having a great time enjoying the little box.",pos
Perfect for streaming movies and tv shows that aren't offered on regular cable,pos
"nice addtion too my television it is so easy to use,",pos
This is simply the best and most TV for the money. I should have cut the cable years ago!,pos
Able to watch Amazon Prime now on our smart TV. Easy install and breeze to work!,pos
Very good picture quality. Performs as advertised and worth the prize paid for.,pos
I've cancelled my cable. Best purchase I've made in a long time. The picture quality is amazing.,pos
The best purchase I have made in years. Wish I would have done it sooner,pos
Purchased this to test it out. I have a prime membership. The interface seems a little slow and not as intuitive as other streaming players however do like the 4K capability for the price,pos
"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV because I wanted to be able to watch Sony Vue in the bedroom without having to get another Playstation console. We have an Apple TV (newer model), and I like it a lot too, but the Fire TV allows me to watch both Amazon Prime content and the Sony Vue channels, which I can't on my Apple TV. The Amazon Fire TV is very responsive, has great Apps, it is lightweight and doesn't take up much room. In fact, we have it hanging in the back of our TV which is mounted to the wall, and you can't even see it. I highly recommend it.",pos
"don't have a smart tv, so this fire tv is perfect for downloading Netflix, vudu, and any other apps. a must for tv watchers",pos
"The Fire TV is much faster than the Fire Stick. It's super-compact. It has a better antenna, so it can pick up the wifi signal from farther away than the fire stick. It also supports 4K streaming and has more memory than the fire stick (this means gaming capability). The only downsides are: you must sign in/create an Amazon account (which is free), it doesn't come with an HDMI cord (which is required for use), and it doesn't have expandable memory. Overall, it is well worth the price and I would suggest spending the extra $60 and purchasing the Fire TV instead of the Fire Stick.",pos
Most tv's come with all the viewing apps you need but they're not portable. FireTV has everything you want plus it fits neatly in your suitcase.,pos
"Great product, I bought one last year and loved it. Had to buy another for the guest room. Having Alexa makes it even easier to use.",pos
"We bought the box to see if it would make sense to dump cable. The ease of use is one sell, but the fact I can watch anything and not worry about junk sold it for me.",pos
"This product works better than the smart tv function of our current tv, simplifies the process and especially the search function. no more clicking and scrolling thru the alphabet...just speak it and let it search for you - that alone is worth the $",pos
It was everything I expected it to be. Very pleased. I would recommend this product and your store to everyone I know.,pos
i really rely on this product . I watch movies and and lots of Tv Shows.i would really recommend this product to everyone.,pos
"Simple, easy to use. Keep all the tv apps in one place",pos
Best device for Kodi. Works perfetly no issues at all,pos
I own the Apple TV and I wanted to try out the Fire TV and am glad I did.,pos
"love these boxes! use them on a regular basis, would recomend",pos
Super easy to install to your hdmi. Just signup for a Amazon account and you are off to the best streaming experience.,pos
Easy fast and portable great fun for everyone!!!!!,pos
It's a really cool device with a ton of apps but it often will freeze if left on to long,pos
"This is a great product with many options for movies, games, music and much much more",pos
"Most people buy this for use with Amazon Prime, but that isn't absolutely necessary as there are many other useful apps that are available.",pos
The product was easy to setup and use. I really like it.,pos
"Works great IMO altho when I first got it home the remote didn't work and appeared corroded insidewe called the store and they said I had to call some parts store, which said they were out of remotesKind of a run around IMO I got the remote fixed myself Other than that the box works grest",pos
I purchased the Amazon Fire because you can get the PS Vue app. The system is easy to use and the picture quality is great.,pos
"I purchased this box in hopes of using it for the new Playstation Vue service which it did run pretty well. It does everything they say it does but one of the main issues I had with the original and still have with this is the interface. The layout for the main screen and the ads they throw in your face are just ridiculous. After using Roku for years, the Nvidia Shield TV, and the new Apple TV I would recommend any of those over this device any day. They offer a much cleaner interface and more functionality for the most part (except playstation vue).",neg
Great little device to save money. Streams live and on demand TV. Great way to save money on TV subscriptions,pos
"I use this device to collaborate all my entertained needs. Amazon Prime, Netflix, Plex, etc.",pos
"Love it, but at times it just goes black. I have to unplug and hook back up order for it to work, sometimes multiple times. Same with the reg fire stick that i have on anther TV.",pos
I'm so happy with my purchase! Very easy to install. Love the interface. Well priced. Haven't had any issues.,pos
love it....very nice...really easy to navigate and it has a lot of things. Control remote easy to operate,pos
"What i love about this is that there is no buffering, no commercials and it runs smoothly. Very user friendly and fun to use.",pos
Better than fire stick a lot faster loading lots of movies and games great product,pos
"Just purchased to replace my regular firestick. The system runs faster, better processor. It can handle the games alot better then the firestick. The voice remote is a cool add on. If you dont play games i wouldnt really reccomend upgrading to the fire tv box, just get the firestick. Hdmi and router cable arent included. The wifi actually worked better then when it was plugged in. Not sure why. Good purchase..I would recomend this over the chromecast or apple tv anyday.",pos
"It's the amazon version of AppleTv. I guess I expected something a little more ""wow"" for the cost, but it looks like amazon's app on my xbox and smart tv. Not anything super special. It works as intended though and not really any problems. The remote feels flimsy compared to the aluminum of the apple tv gen 1-3",pos
Easy to use and work great with amzn prime. Lots of flexibility. Not as slick as Apple TV but at half the price a great value,pos
These are the best you can get! I have bought 2 already,pos
"Look no further excellent streaming device, great processor , good ram , expandable storage , also supports 4k what else could you ask for",pos
Best streaming device I know. Easy to use. Great purchase,pos
Bought it for my niece who is autistic and she loves it . works great and easy to use.,pos
Love it! Easy to navigate! Even my toddler can do it!,pos
Good price while on sale. Also reward is the reason I go there,pos
"We love the fire TV stick, got one for each TV and got rid of cable. Subscribed to PlayStation Vue instead. However we had to get a new Blackhawk router because we were constantly streaming, before that the TV was buffering tons. Works great now.",pos
Once you get the Amazon box you don't need to pay for cable again!,pos
"Works great with Kodi, enough power to direct play h265. SD card slot is a bonus for apps and USB for external media. Threw my Roku away.",pos
At the price pout you will not find a better product!,pos
"Great Streaming tool, I own this and the the firestick. Have been able to cut the cord finally",pos
Easy to set up. Availability of service is great. Enjoy the selections.,pos
"I purchased this when I cut cable since at the time it was the only device that had a Sony Playstation Vue App. Although Roku added this channel almost immediately after I purchased the Fire TV, the user interface for Vue is better on the Fire TV. Roku has more apps / channels. However, Fire TV is still a decent compliment and the 4K capability makes this a viable option. Speed and performance is good.",pos
Features that i never thought I would be interested.,pos
"Compared to Dish Prices, this is a good option. It allows you to customize TV stations to a degree. It has the potential to replace dish in the long run if you have an internet connection.",pos
Perfect for my busy family. We can all watch shows and without having to watch them the day they run. Lots of extras and easy to use.,pos
"I own a couple FireSticks and decided to give the Fire Tv a try. I'm glad I did because you can tell the difference right out of the box. Not that there is anything wrong at all with the stick, but the smooth speed and response is a welcomed attribute to my most used television.",pos
"Amazon Fire tv is just an amazing addition to your tv. Even if you have a smart tv, the ability to add so many more apps than your smart tv platform provides is great. Very customizable. Love it!",pos
"I use it frequently and have enjoyed watching shows. I would have given it a perfect score, but not all of my shows are on it.",pos
We bought this to replace a Roku 3 that had died. This is an excellent streaming device! It has roughly the same specs as a Roku 4 but is much less expensive. I definitely recommend this!,pos
I'm very happy with this. It's easy to use and I'd recommend this.,pos
"Love it!! I installed a app that allows me to watch almost every movie and tv show for free! Never have any problems with it and works really well, if you can't afford cable or direct tv this would be the next best thing to do but you do need the internet for it to work.",pos
item has a fast processor and is cheaper than the Roku and Apple TV for cord cutting,pos
"Very easy setup, I recommend hard wiring, if possible, it has all the apps we use, including Sling TV!",pos
"I purchased this device to stream movies to a room that had minimal apps. The I tried to activate Netflix, I kept getting an error on log-in. Then after contacting Amazon Tech help & researching found out that Amazon & Netflix parted ways and do not support each other. So, I returned the device and purchased the Roku4 instead to great satisfaction.",neg
This product is wonderful. If your looking for a way to get rid of cable this is the way to go.,pos
"Great product, very easy to apply and I LOVE IT :)",pos
"Decided to try the Amazon Fire to replace our cable TV. Since I'm already an Amazon Prime member for other reasons, this was only a one-time expense for me. It was a very good choice - the Amazon Fire has given me the flexibility to watch what I want to watch and when without having to record and monitor what I record on the DVR. With the Amazon Fire I'm in control and not the cable company Even with adding Hulu & Sling, I'm still saving $100 each month!",pos
"Love the blue tooth remote, does freeze up from time to time",pos
I love it!! I would definately refer my friends and family to buy one for their TV's also,pos
"Easy setup, fast.Had everything ROKU has plus games.",pos
"Got this to replace a Roku. Similar content but more features and a seems bit faster. Only knock is minor: could be a bit more customizable. But overall an excellent, sleek interface.",pos
"I love it ! I use it every day for music, movies, and current events. The voice command remote is awesome. Cant wait to buy the video game controller for it to play first Gen. Nintendo games",pos
"If you are a Amazon Prime or PlayStation Vue member, this is a must buy. Easy to use connect. Simple log in. Intuitive guide. Small, but not too small. Great remote. Relatively inexpensive. 4k qualityOnly wish I could transfer remote features to my Logitech remote.",pos
Nice Streamer. Has lots of movies and Television Showes.,pos
I've had the Fire 1st gen and Fire stick. All have been great. The added power on this 2nd gen is great.,pos
Easy and fast access to all popular apps. Appreciate the voice search on the remote.,pos
"MAJOR KEY... You need this in your life .. If you buy anything else besides this congratulations ""Ya played Yourself"" #BlessUp",pos
This unit streams it all. Works great. No buffering. Easy to set and and use.,pos
"I use this to access playstation vue, Netflix, Hulu, youtube, kodi and Amazon prime. This works great as a replacement for directv and it paid for itself the first month.",pos
"They have so much stuff that I am not sure where to start. Its fast, reliable, and easy to set up. I have the yearly Amazom Prime membership and it includes their tv service and also their music app with no ads. A must have if your into watching a lot of tv like myself.",pos
Very smooth and easy to use. I would buy another..,pos
Great product!!!! Would totally recommend it to anyone!!!,pos
I had a hard time trying to stream movies even with a good internet connection ....was a little disappointed,neg
"Although I did like the Roku navigation a little better, the Amazon Fire TV has given us everything we need to feel good about not having cable anymore. We started with one and have gone back to buy 2 more.",pos
Fire tv is great no problems at all the best purchase I've made this year,pos
"Expandable memory option was a big plus, 4k video output when streaming video is great and I was able to load programs to watch free movies and ppv.",pos
Works. You must have the unit hard wired to your network to get the unit to sync with your phone or tablet so they can be used as a remote.,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is simply awesome. I use it for HULU AND NETFLIX,pos
"Great device for streaming movies! Works great, very satisfied!",pos
I had the fire stick and the fire Tv is so much better.,pos
Works like a charm and am Bert pleased with my purchase,pos
"I may be slow to catch on to ""streaming."" I was unaware of the depth of available media material. Things to consider are Internet download speed (30 Mbs minimum) and too many choices. It is similar to the Internet before the World Wide Web (www). Some Android apps such as Kodi with Fire TV Guru make some of the material more easily accessible. Good luck!",pos
"Easy setup , when you install very very easy, good",neg
My family loves the firetv. The only thing we had to do was upgrade our Internet speed.,pos
I really love both Amazon tv and Apple TV as products. I do wish Amazon tv has a simplified AirPlay ability for iOS. I'm sure with apps you buy and other methods you can accomplish it but if it was just standard like Apple TV AirPlay I would give this product 5 stars. For cheap easy price it makes a great gift. Where it beats Apple TV is 4 k streaming. So if you want 4K get Amazon Fire tv.,pos
"Didn't compare to the fire stick, unknown if better product, but love amazons creation",pos
great results with this product. it is easy to use and exactly what I expected it to be.,pos
I gave this Amazon fire stick as a Father's Day present. So i am not a personal user of the product but have heard it was nice.,pos
"It is ok for the average user. But it os not good enough for Kodi. The interface is ok, but a little too busy for me. I did not like the fact that I could not use my universal Harmony remote with it. Jodi also takes almost an hour to set up and it buffers way more than on the Shield.",neg
It's good but to get more connection and less buffing get the one with the Internet cable,pos
Its definitely a great purchase. Its definitely an upgrade from the fire stick.,pos
Great purchase and the product is amazingly simple,pos
This product has been amazing! We got a great deal on the purchase and we have not been disappointed with it's productivity!,pos
I have 2 of these in my home and love them. Alexa voice commands are fun to mess with. I use these for Amazon Prime Services and Netflix mostly. This model is more than double the speed of the sticks and have 4K support. I love the expandable storage and the fact I have KODI on these bad boys makes it all the better.,pos
"This fire box is the best you can get for a cheap price. It runs surprising well and so far have had no issues with wifi streaming Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Netflix. Definitely even worth more if you have Prime for the streaming from Amazon. Only minor problem is restrictions on most add-on apps due to going through Amazon and not Google Play but there are various work arounds.",pos
I found this product to be faster the other competitors products,pos
"This is my second unit, this one is 1080p with 4k ultra high definition built in and I love it, if you buy one, you will also love it.",pos
Really easy to work with lots of extras. Good buy for kids and adults,pos
"The Amazon Fire TV is a great streaming box. I also have the Amazon Fire TV Stick which is just as good. The reason I gave the Fire TV only 4-stars is because I see no reason to even have the Fire TV as the Fire TV Stick is just as good if not better, considering its size, than the box. Sure with the box you get better performing specs out of it but what for? In my performance reviews, the Fire TV Stick performed on par with the Fire TV box. The choice is up to you as they are both great streaming devices. However, save yourself some money and go with the Fire TV Stick!",pos
"I picked up the Fire TV because I already owned 3 Fire Sticks and was happy with them. I wanted a unit that I was familiar with and I""m glad I bought this one. I don't really use Alexa so that didn't play a part in the purchase. However, you really see the dual core processing power when you start apps. It's a good bit faster than the Fire Sticks with the same ease of use. As an added bonus, you can install and play games. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",pos
"I had a fire tv stick and it works great, so wanted to try the fire tv box. Works great and loads much faster.",pos
"Excellent purchase, satisfied my needs for entertaining television!",pos
"pretty good, works great and is very easy to install,",pos
Compared to the cheaper model this one streams a lot faster and smoother,pos
"Well built. Great, especially if you add the Kodi app.",pos
This is a much faster and easy to use media player.,pos
Great device for all your media needs. Plugs right in and ready to go and isn't hard to operate!,pos
To date I've experienced 0 issues. I'm a cord cutter and Amazon Fire tv has helped make that possible.,pos
Converts any TV into a smart TV. Added Kodi to mine and works great.,pos
It is a great product would buy another one soon .,pos
"Way better than the fire stick, load faster and can be plugged straight to the router",pos
It's good but not greatDoes everything form movies to tv and apps and gamesAlso there are plenty of mods out there for more features,pos
I bought this for my daughter. She is 14 and loves it. It was simple to set up and to use. Speaking into the remote makes finding what you want even easier.,pos
"The fire tv box is great, houses tons of apps and games. I like it so much I have a box on all four tv'shows in my house.",pos
Great Roku TV; wish I had a separate remote for local channels,pos
Works great! Super fast and does everything one would want.,pos
"Awesome Video streamer, once rooted, unlocked and loaded the possibilities are truly unlimited.",pos
Great product would've given 5 stars only problem is that it kinda freezes at times after having it on standby for a few hours so I have to restart it from the menu settings other than that it's an awesome product,pos
Bought this for my wife because she wanted to be able to access her Amazon Prime content. It has a beautiful picture and streams great.,pos
I love it. IT is programmable and easy to use. The voice command is very nice.,pos
I purchased the firebox for tv in living room. I later purchased fire stick for bedroom. The box downloads faster. Amazon has lots of good movies and tv shows. Excellent music selection,pos
I had an Apple TV but replaced it with this Fire tv on my main tv because it offered the same features but added 4K which a comparable Apple tv did not. It works flawlessly and I couldn't be happier.,pos
I purchased 2 regular amazon fire sticks around $50 each they would turn off in the middle of shows/movies and weren't working properly I had several issues with them so I decided to give this model a go and it's been worth it so far no issues.. worth the extra $$ it's reliable.,pos
I absolutely love my fire tv it is amazing for everything,pos
Easy peasy to install and operate remote controller!,pos
Lots and lots of channel to watch. better viewing and entertaining to use.,pos
"It was easy to hook up, and it is easy to use, the directions are complete. Would recommend to anyone wanting to supplement their cable or dish services.",pos
Help me cut the cable cord Easy set up Plenty of apps Good user interface,pos
This is the best device for streaming very fast....,pos
"Installed easily. No issues so far. Using it for netflix, amazon prime, and playstation vue.",pos
I seriously use this every day... Do some research on what is really available to do with this device and you will not regret spending the 100$ plan on buying one for everyone I know at the holidays this year.,pos
This product is amazingly faster than the firestick and would recommend this over the stick any day of the week,pos
"What good device I recommend these product,Works fine",pos
The Amazon Fire tv is a great way to watch your favorite shows and movies. It's easy to use and the best part it was not too expensive.,pos
I love the load up speed there on great and a great way to enjoy netflix,pos
I've been using it for a while and can say that watching 4k streaming movies and shows are awesome.,pos
I purchased this to use Playstation Vue and it seems to be working well. I also use if for Youtube and Netflix. Quite a few reviews commented on the remote losing connection with the main unit but I have not had that problem.,pos
Fire Tv was easy to install and very user friendly.,pos
"This Fire TV is perfect for my intended use, I have cut the cable with the big cable companies and plan to use this for a long time.",pos
Have a few fire tv sticks but they lag a little bit. The box is worth the extra money.,pos
Love the box and the stick both. They are easy to use as well.,pos
These box is amazing!!! A must if you have Amazon Prime.,pos
It was easy to set up and very quick on the upload.,pos
"i recently cut the cable and was looking for something to have all my streaming apps in one place without having to mirror a phone or tablet, and without having to connect a pc to a tv. this works amazing, never had any problems with it whatsoever, very easy to use, pretty straight forward. highly recommended!",pos
"Great for Sling TV, Vevo, YouTube, etc. Must have.",pos
"Works well, setup is extremely easy. Replaced my directv subscription and We are very happy with it.",pos
very fast netflix streaming!! great item at a great price!!,pos
This is one of the best media player i have owned.,pos
"Easy to set it up, and it's paying for itself because I'm cancelling some cable channels",pos
I have enjoyed this product everyday since I purchased it. I would highly recommend it.,pos
love it. does what it does extremely well. The fastest box i own and I've owned them all.,pos
This is a very very good product. I would recommend this to anyone.,pos
"I bought the fire tv to replace my rented cable box....Ditched traditional cable and am using fire tv with playstation vue app....picture quality is excellent, was paying almost $200/mo with traditional cable, now paying $40/mo for basically the same channels....",pos
"Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) - Black is great. It has all the entertainment and apps that my family and I need. Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, HBO, Amazon Prime TV, and Movies. It is definitely a fun device for playing a few games, watching movies, etc.... Connects to android game controllers for added fun. I believe it is 4k also.",pos
Great picture and worth the money. Great for even older TV's.,pos
"I bought both the Amazon tv & the fire stick. I prefer this product cause it has a few extra perks such as 4K streaming, multi channel audio & hard wired connection to name a few.",pos
I quit cable all together and stream everything I watch using this box.,pos
First day of purchase it overheats. Defective product.,neg
Buyer beware They say it's free tv...ITS NOT!You have to pay for everything! I wish I would have bought this before I cancelled my cable.,neg
This doesn't have the ability to control volume or turn off and on the tv. Liked the programming didn't like the features.,pos
Enjoy being able to use this box to stream 4K content even.,pos
Great system enjoying every second of it. So easy to use.,pos
I use it all the time for Television. It works quickly and has good quality.,pos
"I thought the Firestick was the way to go but the lack of buffering from the tv box is all i need to watch everything with no worry of it stopping or cutting off, if you don't have one you need to get one asap!!!!",pos
"Can't recommend the Fire TV enough. This is the best media player on the market, and we've compared it to Roku and Chromecast. We use it more than our Smart TV's apps. Also works pretty well with Playstation Vue if you're using it for TV.",pos
Great product compact easy to use fits right into the back of your TV. has a video tutorial that makes set up an installation very simple works great. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a streaming device at a reasonable cost,pos
A friend recommended this. And I am loving how easy it was to use.,pos
"Great buy. Wonderful product, was the Best Buy that I made",pos
The best streaming device on the market right now. Don't waste you money on anything else,pos
"Love the speed, voice search and content this product provides!!!",pos
Super Fast and good storage. Cool I was able to iunstall Kodi and easy access.,pos
"Great product, works as described. Has a lot of apps to choose from. One downside, I had a 2010 LG tv and the tv was too old to use the Amazon Fire tv. The Fire tv requires the tv to be hdcp 2.0 compliant. Many older tvs are not and won't work on them. Make sure it works before purchase.",pos
"This is my 3rd Fire TV, so yes, I am a proud owner. I am able to watch any program that is on cable television with a simple tweak and you can too if you do a little bit of research. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Heck, I would even recommend it to Charlie Mix.",pos
"I bought it to replace my fire stick and to get surround sound, but it didn't do that, but still decided to keep it",pos
"Bought a Vizio tv with the new google cast and cannot stand it. So I decided to go with the fire tv from Amazon and works great. The 4K streaming is amazing. Only problem is you have to subscribe to Netflix, Amazon prime etc but who doesn't have an account with them these days?",pos
Amazon Fire TV is a great system you able to watch videos on Netflix. Play video games also be able to do a lot of streaming very excellent system I will recommend this for other people to buy if they're wanting to gain more an lot of streaming.,pos
"I did some research on different streaming devices before I bought the FireTV. I would highly recommend it. I actually just cancelled my cable subscription because it works that well. I'm now saving over $100/month, you can't beat that. There are tons of apps and everyone can watch what they want.",pos
Great for streaming...only complaint is the remote is clicky when pushing the buttons. Not good when trying to watch tv while others are sleeping.,pos
"The fire tv has access to numerous applications. If you're looking to replace cable, this is definitely a first start. If youre not, you still have access to lots of movies, apps, tv shows all in one place. Binge watching in full effect!",pos
I live these boxes. Since I installed one on every tv in my house everyone that comes over wants one. I have bought so many for family members as gifts.,pos
I bought the fire stick first then returned it to get the fire tv and let me tell you it was worth the exchange,pos
"Amazon Fire tv is better then fire stick, roku 1,2& 3Streaming is too fast. You will not notice any delays",pos
Amazon Fire TV works great. Picture and streaming is fantastic.,pos
"I use this daily for playstation Vue, constant 60fps and it looks great.",pos
I have multiple streaming devices in my home to include an appletv but I love that the fire stick is small and discreet,pos
Streaming is easy on this 4k ready box. Love the picture quality too. Plus the kids can play games on the big screen.,pos
This little black box is awesome. So easy to setup and use. The choices of entertainment are outstanding,pos
"This is my third Amazon device. I have one on every tv. Works perfectly, and the 2nd Gen has awesome clarity!!",pos
"Great for cable-cutters! It works with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Plex and so many other video services. Highly recommend.",pos
"Not much else to say, except this device replaced my aging Apple TV, I thought I'd give it a shot as Prime is not available (yet) on apple TV. However, this device's sharp picture, reliability and nearly endless number of apps is absolutely outstanding!!",pos
"For the most part, this is a great little streamer. It has most of the apps that I need. Big exception is Xfinity support. I can't run any Xfinity apps from it, and I assume that I cannot run HBO GO because of that. Otherwise, It's fast and easy to use. Love the talking remote.",pos
"it the best for Apps, movies, games and morealso it supports USB DVD drive for playback of DVD and supports sling and playstation TV",pos
"I dumped cable after using streaming and Playstation Vue. I have one Fire TV in my bedroom and loved it so I bought a Fire Stick for downstairs. The Fire Stick was slow by comparison, so I upgraded and have no issues with the Fire TV. The Fire TV is worth the extra money. The variety of services offered and the speed pays off if you have a good connection. I do not have 4K, but I can only assume it will be a quality stream when I do.",pos
"Very good product, very convenient. May buy another",pos
Great product I bought 2 very fast hardly no lag..,pos
This will be our second FireTV and we love these!!,pos
"If you are going to be using this allot I recommend the Fire TV over the Stick, it is much more responsive. The fire stick tends to be a bit laggy when navigating and launching apps.",pos
Has all streaming media platforms. It even supports 4K resolution.,pos
"Run this with EMBY client and it works awesome. Love that it plays h265 no problem, one of the few that can actually do it. Highly recommend. ALOT FASTER than the stick in my opinion.",pos
I would recommend everyone to get this item. You do have to purchase prime for $99 for the year but it will eliminate your cable bill because you have plenty to choose from to watch.,pos
Good product recommend it to everybody very easy to set up,pos
Overall I'm happy with this device (generation 2 ),pos
A very convenient and easy way to watch tv programs,pos
"it does what its supposed to do, turn ur tv into a smart tv altho chromecast has the upper hand because of its lack or chuggy connection to mobile phone",pos
"Unlike the fire stick, this item does not over heat.",pos
The Amazon fire TV is a great item to stream online content,pos
Have a fire stick and it's ok but after using this is wouldn't even consider getting the stick due to the performance of this.,pos
I bought this for my living room Tv works great. No issues what so ever.,pos
"Found this device to be one of the best streamers on the market with Ethernet. Also have an Apple 3rd generation and enjoy this more because of the availability of apps that I cannot get on the Apple device (Amazon Prime, PlayStation Vue).",pos
I bought it for my media room it is great!! Faster than the previous version,pos
Own a firestick and didn't like the lag so I bought the fire tv. Problem solved. Super smooth. Fast. Responsive.,pos
"Setup went smoothly (vs. Roku that could never detect wifi), picture quality very good. Menus a little squirrelly and navigation/selection could be better, but not awful. Only negative so far is that remote seems to devour AAA batteries.",pos
I am not a tv person but I like the movies and tv content. I love pureflix,pos
I loved the first one I bought so much I bought another one for my bedroom. This has replaced the Chromecast which I had on all my TVs. My house is wired with Cat6 and I have a fast internet connection and streaming from Netflix is almost immediate.,pos
Got it for the kids lounge to stream movies. Will get the gaming remote so the can play games.,pos
Bought this to view movies and shows online - worked out pretty good so far!,pos
Purchased fire stick along with fire tv and tv works better,pos
This is all you will ever need this box is fast has a usb slot so you can add space and you can use the wifi or pluge internet directly into it. This is a top end box doesnt buffer,pos
"Love the easy set up, and how easy it is to use. You have many different options for what to watch, with only a click of a button.",pos
"I bought this device to use to replace an Xbox One (for movies/streaming etc not gaming) - so far streaming movies, using the cloud to upload videos/photos work good. My only issue is getting the device to power back on - there is no ""power off"" you can put the device to ""sleep"" but I have had to unplugged it several times to get the unit back online - so far that is my only negative issue",pos
This is perfect. I wanted to cut the cord and I used the free 30 day amazon prime trial. I definitely recommend getting playstation vue!!,pos
Excited to use the Amazon Fire Box. Very easy to use.,pos
"i picked this up for my LED tv that came out a few years ago. this is great because i can use the apps like wwe network, HBO go etc. i got it on sale for 70 bucks deal of the day. well worth it.",pos
Was skeptical about getting rid of cable...love Amazon fire! So many choices and so much cheaper!,pos
Have a Fire stick tv in tvs and upgraded to Fire box tv. Much faster and expandable memory with micro SD slot. Also can direct connect with Ethernet cable.,pos
"Setup for the Amazon Fire TV box was very easy. I was surprised at how little the box actually was, and just how powerful some of the apps and downloadable games were that you can use on the Amazon Fire TV.I ended up ordering the Amazon Fire TV game controller online at Amazon. I am currently not an Amazon Prime member, but may re-consider that decision in time to get even more functionality out of the box.For anyone looking to buy a relatively cheap device to maximize their TV watching and even Console game playing, look no further than the Amazon Fire TV. Although it does not compare to a Playstation IV or X-Box it does have decent graphics on some of the available games.I had also purchased a class 10 64 GB micro SD card for the Amazon Fire TV Box as well and had no trouble formatting it and getting it setup.",pos
Love not paying cable bill. Just wish we could get sling blue.,pos
"Have the gaming version myself but got the normal version for my sister. Can easily load any apps or games you want to run, provided they are android based. Great for streaming with a much higher frame rate then the stick. But the stick works fine for say the kids playroom. Recommend it to anyone looking for a simple and small system. Probably be a go to Christmas give this year.",pos
Very easy to use and install I didn't have any problems with it,pos
Cool. A lot of movies and tv I wouldn't get otherwise,pos
we love this fire box.It gets all of the channels and even new movies that are still in the theater,pos
You get lots of movies & TV show from Amazon Prime,pos
"I have several Fire tv boxes and they all very good for streaming Amazon, Netflix and others. If you have a 4k tv this box will delight you with the ability to stream 4k content.Great buy!!!",pos
"Guys this is Suuuuuper Fast! Forget the fire stick, UPGRADE YOURSELF. You are going to fall in love with it.",pos
The Amazon - Fire TV worked great our needs. It has all the features we liked.,pos
This is pretty good. A little expensive but work fine.,pos
"This is an android based devise, so you can do anything with it. Install Kodi and you are good to want anything you want",pos
Very happy with the firestick. Does everything that I expected.,pos
Very good product and works perfect with my Samsung TV,pos
"What I like most about this device is how smooth it operates. I used to have a Roku stick and experience lag times, and constantly had to restart this device.It has a ton of apps that I use. I would like to see them add ABC go, but I'm satisfied with the variety that is offered.",pos
"So, its ok. I mean, it's not as fast or as seamless as the Apple TV, but it's cheaper. This is my 2nd one. The first one bricked after 15 months of steady use, so because the warranty was expired I bought a new one. I got it home and the remote stopped working for it on the 2nd day. I had just spent a week going back and forth with Amazon trying to troubleshoot my bricked firebox so I wasn't about to delve back into the quagmire that is Amazon customer service. I ended up just downloading the remote app for it instead. If you're a prime member it's a good choice, but if your not just get an Apple TV or roku.",neg
The Amazon Fire TV is an awesome system. We love it and use it every day!,pos
"Highly recommend, fast reliable signal, great quality and convient",pos
This is a great streaming device. Easy to use and user friendly. It says it plays 4K which is a plus. I've streamed Amazon and ps Vue on here and read that games can be played too. I am a chrome cast user so am used to managing everything on my phone not a remote but the remote is nice and has voice control which is great. I just wish the fire tv app would show what you see on screen so you can navigate from your phone instead of having it look like a mousepad. It takes getting used to. Overall it is great addition to my streaming devices.,pos
"Works great even downstairs from my nighthawk router, responds much quicker than fire stick and works great with ps Vue. For sure get this over the stick.",pos
Easy to use! Excellent content! Set-up is simple! Give as gifts.,pos
"If you're looking to cut the cord, this streaming box has you covered. This box has the best app support and works with all the top services on the market. Good remote with app support built in",pos
It does exactly what I bought it for and more. Worth every penny,pos
I recently cut the cord with cable and couldn't be happier. This fire TV box has made it so easy with so many ways to watch programming. I love it!,pos
The only con I see is the exclusion of the optical sound out put. The Micro SD slot is a nice addition.,pos
I love the Amazon Fire. I am able to play all my movies and shows on my fire. It's great!,pos
Love it! Very convenient. Simple to install. No more cable,pos
"This product is easy to set up, the interface is simple to learn and navigate. The remote has voiced activated commands for control of the TV box. The cost of this unit is much less than similar units!",pos
"Great piece of hardware for the price - maybe needs a slgihtly better app selection, but 4K compatible and microSD card slot makes this a a great device for streaming video.",pos
It was really a good idea to buy it during summer. Kids had great time in between other summer activities.,pos
"I would recommend this Amazon smart tv device, very easy setting up and remote on this Amazon smart tv amazing. I will get this device again",pos
Great addition to our home entertainment setup. Connected up with HDMI and was working within minutes.,pos
"Once hooked up, great product. Be sure to have a router large enough to deliver streaming tv.",pos
"The old Fire TV's had an optical audio out S/PDIF, the new ones only have an HDMI output. Great if you have a new A/V setup that has HDMI pass-through on the receiver, not so good if you want to run video through HDMI and audio to your receiver.I should have probably considered a Roku.",neg
Seems to be a great unit with great accessibility.,pos
This is hands down the best media streaming device available today. If you have a 4k tv the box enhances the resolution any other tv the sticks will work fine.,pos
"Set up was easy, content is plenty. My only issue so far is that I use the Amazon fire tv for Playstation Vue, and the guide functionality is horrible. I'm not sure whether to blame it on the amazon fire tv or the playstation vue, but considering the guide is different between the amazon fire tv and the fire stick, I'm going to assume that amazon has some control over the guide for it's products. With that being said I'm definitely disappointed. Hopefully over the next couple months the guide functionality improves. Other than that it has been fantastic!",pos
"Have not used for standard fire tv features. Bought to run kodi, which it works fine for. Freezes occasionally needing hard reboot. Worth the extra $ over doing kodi on streaming stick which lacks memory / cpu.",pos
"I've owned a fire stick, chromecast, Apple TV and Roku, This is by far my favorite device for cutting cords!",pos
The products works as advertised and has been satisfactory to this point. It is somewhat complicated but if the instructions are followed closely there are no problems.,pos
Still learning how to use. Would love to get local channels.,pos
"The Amazon tv works great! Fast loading, and no buffering. Works awesome with the Kodi app!",pos
Apps are easy to find . I would recommend this product to a friend,pos
Did exactly what I wanted it to do and more. Love it!!,pos
Has options to add a scard that increases the low memory constraints on stick. Overall good,pos
Very satisfied with my purchase. Would recommend it to friends and family.,pos
"Great streaming device, and at a fantastic price. Forget the fire-stick get the fire-tv",pos
"Fast streaming, easy setup. Does provide biased options to push Amazon products, however. Great product overall",pos
Roku is great! I would recommend! You can watch a bunch of Movies.,pos
"Purchased to supplement my 4k Tivo & older Apple Tv - very pleased with channels and processor speed ! Attached to 4k 50"" Vizio - Sharp output when connected to 4k HDMI input on Vizio.",pos
This is the best media box for Kodi on a budget. Works great and everything loads just fine,pos
a very easy unit to use. Lots of entertainment options to watch.,pos
"I was so pleased with my Amazon TV Stick on my guest room TV, that I purchased the Amazon TV for my other TV. Awesome!! Awesome!! With those and the Google ChromeCast, I have the world of entertainment at my finger tips.",pos
"I love this Amazon Fire Tv, I can watch all my past shows...i love it so much that I bought 2 Amazon Fire Tv. I would recommend this to my family members.",pos
This is a great alternative to cable. I get all my amazon videos and streaming apps for a lot less than paying for cable and the picture quality is streamed at 1080p. Happy with purchase.,pos
I really like this product. Work well. I don't need cable anymore.,pos
Very good product and easy to set up. I've used it everyday and enjoy it!,pos
Thumbs up. This was a good substitute to replace the current cable provider you use. Canadian customers would like this the best.,pos
I was going to buy Roku 3 but the team member suggested buying Fire TV instead. I'm glad I did cause you can get Kodi on this and it's still got HBO and Netflix. Works great!,pos
The fire tv has been a great addition to my entertainment system! The customer service was great! My sales associate helped me make a decision by having all the information i needed! This is an example of why i remain a loyal customer.,pos
I bought this and we have had no problems at all with it,pos
I'm enjoying it and finding it to be good except it doesn't record.,pos
I love the ability to connect to the Internet via Ethernet cable. I had fewer buffering issues. The upscaling quad core processor also made for a clearer picture.,pos
"My old fire stick had just died. So I upgraded, now I have the power to stream with no lag.",pos
I just cancelled cable it's very easy to set up and tons of options to watch. Ask Alexia anything you want any she has an answer.,pos
Good product to have for your family entertainment.,pos
this is better than having Dish network or Direct TV program in what you need and there it is.,pos
The Fire TV is by far the best of any of the Stream Boxes,pos
Beats having cable with a faster processor than the firestick. Nice!,pos
"Many options. Bye bye cable. Happy family, happy kids.",pos
"I bought this Fire tv because I have unsmart tv that I would like to watch Netflix in, and I think it was a good thing to do and it is not expensive",pos
I had a fire stick an moved up to the fire tv like it every thing loads faster then fire stick an it small an low profile design makes it nice to hide,pos
"I was looking for entertainment in my man-cave without a lot of complicated wiring. The Fire TV is for me!! I just plugged it into my television, setup my wifi and that was it. It took me no time at all before I was enjoying high quality movies in my man-cave!! I highly recommend this product!!",pos
i love the service when it works. several times it had to be reset and now it's finally dead. i've had it less than a yr now...,neg
Love my fire box. Already had the stick and loved it so this was a no brainer!!,pos
Easy plug and play. Great little addition to the TV experience!!!,pos
"Quad core planty of on board ram, and expandable storage? If this can't play it, you don't need it!",pos
I bought the Amazon stick and box due to many people telling me how great it was. Well I've had no better experience than getting this and watching as many movies and TV shows as I want for free! Just upgrade your wireless Internet package and you will love it.,pos
Great product! Lots of channels from everywhere. Easy set up,pos
"If you need help making a decision in what product to buy then hope I can quickly help you make that decision. This is a great product for 90% of us out there. If you have a 4K TV then get the 2016 version of the Fire TV. If you have to decide between a Firestick or a Fire TV then get the Fire TV. The processor speed difference alone is worth the price difference. If you want the best out there then the Nvidia Shield TV is for you. Either way, Amazon made a great product in the Fire TV. Some key features are the microSD expansion, ability to use a controller for some mild gaming, and voice activated remote. Get Prime and have access to all of Amazon's video and music streamin service..",pos
It was bought for my husband and he has truly enjoyed it.,pos
I would like this product a lot more if it came with a remote control that is not as small as the original,pos
it works great. the resolution is excellent. the streaming is great. loving it so far. just a bit pricy,pos
We truly enjoy our Fire tv. It gives us a wide range of viewing from tv shows to movies,pos
"It works well, it's the same as using the firestick to me just cost more.",pos
I no longer has a cable tv bill with the exception of high speed internet. Fire TV has helped in lower my monthly expense to Comcast.,pos
"You cannot beat the fire stick for the money, a great bargain to say the least.",pos
Using this to add to the media capabilities of my TV. Works great..,pos
This was honestly one of the best products I have ever bought!,pos
Does everything I need in a box tie it in with Amazon prime and its all you need,pos
Awesome I will definitely recommended this to anyone,pos
Great streaming box to watch anything from the internet.,pos
"TWC digital adapter now returned. With Black Friday pricing this will pay for itself in months using TWC app, plus already a prime member. Have stick, but needed a little more oomph for gaming on the big screen",pos
I absolutely love this device. Makes my life so much easier.,pos
I lied the shows it offer. I really like the ease of installation,pos
I got this to use DirectvNow and it works great.....,pos
Offers a lot of bang for your buck. Just started using a month ago and love it.,pos
"I was hesitant in buying one of these but I took the risk and the risk paid off. It's an amazing piece of hardware in a little box, not to mention a stylish box. If your looking for a streaming box? Look no further!",pos
"This is a very great product, I love all the movies",pos
I like amazon fire tv it is good. but some times it is little slow and that is why I am giving it 4 star.,pos
"I owned 2 Fire Sticks. I wanted a device I could hardwire my Ethernet connection and have the ability to stream 4K content, so I purchased the upgraded Fire TV Player. I'm a Primer Member so this device is a no brainer for me to fulfill my streaming needs. Highly recommended.",pos
"I got this new fire tv with the purpose of canceling my cable company, I save 88$ every month and I'm very happy with it.",pos
Easy to set. Easy to use. So glad I upgraded my Fire Stick to the Fire Tv box.,pos
Easy to setup and use connects to Wi Fi and streams flawlessly. There are a lot of free channels to stream. Great product that can do so much. I highly recommend this product for the diehard that is into steaming TV from the internet.,pos
"I like this product. I have the fire stick, but wanted to move to a faster processor so I could run Kodi. Works well.",pos
"Cutting the Cable TV cord. Mostly very positive, only negatives are lack of fast forwarding on some channels. Cannot get the CW channel but that is available via free app. Over all it rocks.",pos
This was a great buy for me. You can watch many movies and tv shows for free,pos
So glad I got this! Awesome addition to our house!,pos
Its a great item if your looking to cut down on cable tv evrything you are looking for,pos
The processor is much faster and is pretty responsive.,pos
The Amazon Firebox process a lot faster then the fire stick. Both product is good. I connect the box to my router and it zip to Netflix in a zap.,pos
The FireTV unit was very easy to set up. Just had to connect the HDMI cable to the box and the TV and we were in business. The remote control worked great - although inside of HULU it took a little time to figure out how to get back to the HULU home page (just keep hitting the return button) -- but that's a HULU issue. The FireTV connected quickly to the home WIFI.,pos
I love how you can play games on it and have all of your account all-in-one!!!,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is excellent for streaming video. Also a great platform to install Kodi.,pos
I am extremely satisfied with this streaming device. I was not sure if it was for me but the FireTv has all the processor speed that I have needed and with Sling TV I was able to drop my TV service provider.,pos
The Fire TV is a wonderful device. I have the Stick and I think that the TV is much better.,pos
"With so many program choices available with Amazon Fire Stick, why would you want cable? Cable is just too expensive. This is a much cheaper alternative to cable.",pos
"Amazon Fire TV is good overall, needs little more options like casting from phone and laptop and need to improve little bug in software to get better interaction and performance.",pos
Great product. Speed and quality is awesome. Easy to use. My kids are able to navigate to there favorite programs.,pos
Fire Tv is fast . I recommend this to everyone ! All my co workers purchased them too,pos
"This thing is great very quick streaming and no issues so far, love the voice controller on finding shows or movies.",pos
This fun device has changed our viewing habit. The diversity is great.,pos
This purchase opened up so many options for viewing that we didn't have before. Easy to install and operate.,pos
The list of shows/movies you can watch with this thing is endless. This is a very powerful unit for under a $100. They have a huge selection of app's and games. And you can use your iphone as a remote. I enjoy this unit so much I have one on every tv in my house and they make great gifts.,pos
I love these because they are able to be programmed and watch anything and everything in the world!,pos
"We had a Netgear streaming device for years which was adequate until the remote quit functioning. After checking it out online and visiting the store I felt comfortable purchasing this device. It was easy to setup and get online. It is amazing how much faster, better and smoother our streaming has been. The built in apps are good and there were many more (free) apps that I found and installed without a problem. Some that I installed required that I have a cable TV subscription and so I had to ""log in"" to get them functional but not a big deal. The unit itself is not cheap in appearance nor in quality. It has a nice weight to it and feels substantially durable. The remote is great and the Android App is even better. My local Best Buy store had enough in stock and no hassles. We love our Amazon Fire TV!",pos
Purchased the Fire Box a couple of months ago and it's a great addition to the theatre room for watching movies. Easy to use and good download speed.,pos
The fire TV is excellent and allows me to watch in 4k. Works well.,pos
Always great amazon product. Wish I could download to hard drive.,pos
Very easy to install. Got all I want and if you like apps you love this.,pos
My firebox is connected with my verizon internet and plays excellent movies.,pos
Offers much more entertainment Very responsive no buffering time,pos
I love my Fire TV! I'm both an Amazon Prime and Netflix customer and this works very well for me! I haven't had mine very long but I use them everyday ( I have 2 of them) so I am learning to navigate through them very well. I also use the Amazon Music quite a lot! Great product!,pos
"Totally satisfied. Also own Apple TV, which I ended up moving to bedroom and putting fire stick on main TV. Fire stick seems to be more ""open"" to multiple programmings compared to App Store only programs with Apple TV. But, In defense for Apple TV it's syncing abilities with my iPhone and MacBook are well received. Price wise Firestick has the advantage.",pos
"Love IT!, Simple to use, very fast response as to my DVD with NetflixI recommend to have IT!",pos
"I had the Fire Stick, but upgraded to the Fire TV so run Kodi. Works great",pos
"This is one of the best product amazon have on the market now, very fast and reliable.",pos
Easy to set up. Love the Alexa integration. Very happy!,pos
I like this product and most anything from best buy.The product is easy to operate.,pos
Using to have PlayStation Vue. Works great and can be used for other services,pos
Just hooked it up works great don't know how I ever got by without it,pos
"a good product, I would recommend it to others looking for similar products",pos
I bought this item as an alternative for Netflix and I got rid of Netflix as soon as I got it. Amazing product.,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is great. It was easy to set up and start using. The menu is very user friendly and easy to navigate.,pos
I ended up having to get this or a Roku to use my playstation vue since my Samsung smart tv doesn't allow it. This works great!,pos
"If you dont mind taking a few extra steps to download programs then its great. We got rid of cable and have amazon instead. Also love the voice command, just wish game controller wasn't so much the systym was 99 and the game controller is 50.",pos
Has everything you want in the product . But doesn't have Wi-Fi,pos
Less buffering and better picture than previous Fire TV stick.,pos
It works great. If you have a chance to get one I would recommend it.,pos
Very easy to use. Purchased it watch Amazon Video and to use my Playstation Vue account. Works well with both.,pos
"Well worth the investment. Picture quality is on par with Verizon FiOS. Purchased 2 units. One used wirelessly the other via LAN connection. Without a loop, picture quality very similar. Highly recommended.",pos
better than I expect a and with Alexander is magical,pos
This Firebox allows you to upgrade memory to store content.I love how it has alexa on it.,pos
These things are awesome. I buy them all the time for my employees as bonuses or gifts. They are reliable and durable. Don't over heat and hold up nicely. Great product.,pos
I currently have two fire TVs in my home. Prior to this I had an apple TV which was the one before the newest generation of 2016. It became obsolete with slow streaming speeds all the time. After purchasing the Fire TV I can honestly say its the best bargain in town. The price is just right and has not been an issue in speed or clarity for streaming all your favorite movies shows. The ease of use is also a big plus. I highly recommend if you are on the fence.,pos
Well worth the money. It does everything it say it will do and more.,pos
We are able to watch lots of different programming,pos
Lots of content to access 4k quality easy setup and easy to navigate,pos
"Compared to Roku provides more flexibility for those who like to use these units beyond standard. I don't give 5 stars because the interface is okay, but I much prefer Plex's looking view.I was going insane with my slow Samsung ""Smart Hub"" tv on my second TV... purchasing this was a good decision.Overall I recommend these units.",pos
Love this thing. I've had my 4K tv for a while now and now I feel it's complete with the Fire TV. Lots of ways to find and watch 4K content.,pos
I was really surprised at how much you can do with Fire TV. Thank you,pos
"One of the best products to have, save so much money on the long run. I use this instead of having cable and it works even better. It's half the cost of one monthly cable bill and I have access to 100x more channels. You will need one amazon tv box per tv unless you don't mind moving it from the living room to the bedroom.",pos
I enjoy this product. So easy to attach and use by all,pos
I bought it to help with cutting the cord. I use it mostly to access PlayStation vue service and it works great. If i were a amazon prime member i imagine it would be great to access the prime content. The fire box allows for direct wire to the modem and loads faster than the fire stick which is wifi only.,pos
The Fire TV is the best device to stream PlayStaion Vue. Its super fast and Alexa is amazing.,pos
it works better than the other product that I have,pos
Had the fire stick but I just bought a 4K tv and upgraded the Netflix to stream 4K. Loved the fire stick so much only made sense to buy the fire tv box. It's super easy to use. Great interface.,pos
I had a non smart tv and this was easy to use and very efficient.,pos
I have had a blast since I purchased this Amazon Fire tv. I had issues with the remote but after calling they immediately sent me a replacement. Great service and I am considering reducing my cable now since I can do so much cheaper through this item now.,pos
Now my bedroom TV is the smartest TV in the house. The voice command makes this a breeze to use. It hooks me up to Netflix in seconds instead of minutes like the blue-ray players on my other TV's.,pos
"Love it, had Roku 2,3 and this replaced all of them. Would high recommend this over Fire Stick, faster and can add extra memory...Cut cable and use this as our primary tv source along with antenna for local channels kid love as well very easy to use...",pos
"Good device, use it often, wish I would have waited for a sale. Otherwise, works well, I've been using this more and more, especially given the rising costs of cable. If you can wait until the next day to catch your show, and have an HD antennae, you can say bye bye to cable bills (minus the internet, of course). Love what you can do with this, with the included remote, if you have an alexa home system set up with hubs, the voice remote can be used to control alexa. If you're looking for a cheaper version, the stick will work, but if you game at all, this is your best bet, especially with the quicker processor",pos
"I purchased Chromecasts the year they came out and while they served their purpose for two years they are just not very upgradable. I recently bought the Fire Stick and Fire TV Box made by Amazon. I am also a Netflix and Amazon Prime member. Both of these devices are FAR Superior to the options provided by the older Chromecasts AND even the new 4K models. Easy to use and upgradable with many apps and games, and if you have Amazon Prime it is a no-brainer purchase.",pos
"Could not be happier with this purchase. The voice activated command button on the remote works fantastic. If you do not have a smart TV, highly recommend this device. It buffers for maybe 5 seconds to start a show and then displays perfectly.",pos
This box was definitely worth the upgrade than the stick. It's snappier and easy to install programs on.,pos
Great price for the product you receive. Great way to cut cable bill.,pos
This workshould so much better then the firend stick.,pos
"The Amazon Fire TV box is the best choice for your money. It runs smoothly, it's user friendly and it has a great user interface. It has 2gb of memory which is a plus, and it allows you to connect directly to your modem via Ethernet. I find this especially helpful when you are having issues with your wifi or you have many devices in your home connected to your wifi. I have not had any issues with this box!",pos
Fire TV was easy set up and had no buffering issues.,pos
We use this product to side load apps like Kodi. It works really well. I have never experienced any freezing of any kind or any lag time like I have with other products.,pos
This product is great. I bought it because it was cheaper than paying a cable bill.,pos
"Amazon Fire TV is the best streaming device money can buy and will cancel cox, directv and any other programming paying for. It works smoothly with good internet service and cable modem. Best device on market to stream movies and tv shows. Will keep buying them for my family.",pos
Best product to use if your are a movie watcher.i use mine on weekends when it's time to relax or nothing to do.,pos
Easy to use. Many applications. Would recommend to anyone.,pos
great item helpful; staff just what was looking for,pos
"I love the fire tv for so many reasons! It is easy to take along anywhere and you can easily add apps, no need for cable!",pos
"The Amazon fire TV is a simple to install and use as advertised. All you need is your own HDMI cable and everything else is provided for you. Set up took minutes. I really like how fast the Fire TV is. I use it almost exclusively for Netflix, Hulu, and live TV streaming thru PlayStation Vue. I chose the Fire TV over the TV stick because the Fire TV has a faster processor and it works beautifully. I would definitely recommend this box for anyone who's looking to cut the cord from cable.",pos
So happy I made this purchase! Works great for our family. Super fast. No buffering.,pos
The box works great for what I need it for. Installation was easy. Easy to move around within the apps,pos
"I did my research and purchased one of these for one purpose, to side load Kodi on it. I was told in the store by an Associate that Amazon had blocked this ability, but this was not pos. I had no intention of Rooting the box and it was not needed. It side loaded so simply that anyone could do it, no PC needed. It has a faster processing speed and better picture quality then the Amazon Fire Stick..and this does 4K video. Amazing little media box that has tons of entertainment for a small price. If you have fast enough internet I would highly recommend picking one up!",pos
"I love all of my Amazon products including my latest purchase the Amazon fire box. I have the stick o, two tv's and now the box on my new 4k tv. Along with my prime account I am in heaven...",pos
I recommend this product many movies and very clear.,pos
"Love, love love it! Great for turning your tv into a smart tv!",pos
"Just speak into the remote and your thrust on a journey through movies,Internet and shopping.",pos
Amazon knocks it out of the park with this Fire TV. Very easy to use and runs apps faster than Roku. Well worth the money,pos
Have bought 5 of these. Good wifi and has an Ethernet port much faster than fire stick,pos
It is fast and affordable streaming player. All app are supported.,pos
Anything I have time to watch I can see on this box. Cuts cable bill in half.,pos
SIMPLE AND VERY USER FRIENDLY. HAS ALL THE LATEST APPS AND AMAZON'S PRIME USER CONTENT IS SUPERB.,pos
I recently cut cable. This device has all of the apps I want to stream. It has a fast processor and the voice remote works great.,pos
"Less lag than the stick. Ethernet port option is nice. Not too much need though if you wont use extensively. If your a passive user go stick, if you'll everyday and even want to do gaming go box.",pos
"I decided to cut cable and thought this Amazon TV would be a good alternative . It's a great product I really do like it ! It takes a little while to get used to using it ,there's a lot of clicking to get to a show ! However , I am not a prime member so there are a lot of shows that we can't watch !",pos
really like the fire tv works great. def an upgrade from the apple tv,pos
"This product is worth the price. Apple TV may have better features and can link to your laptop and phone, but for the price, Amazon Fire TV is great!",pos
Have owned several roku models and now trying firetv. Definite improvement especially after recent software upgrade. Works great with my prime account & amazon video library.,pos
I have the Amazon stick and wanted a little more speed and storage which this was just great for.,pos
"I never thought it would be possible to get rid of my cable television services, but I did.",pos
"I've been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have to say, I'm loving it! I have an older Samsung ""Smart"" TV, but Samsung has stopped updating the Smart Hub for my model. The Amazon Fire TV gets the latest updates from the Apps (i.e. Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, etc...) , so I know everything will work smoothly!",pos
"With this device, you no longer need anything but wifi.",pos
"Definitely has nice features, however, I prefer the navigation on the Apple TV.",pos
"Love this box, plenty of power for my 60in tv, beautiful picture and sound. Key features for me were the internet hardline even though the wifi in this unit works great and the usb. Easily add on a usb keyboard to make your experience that much better.",pos
Device is user friendly. Very easy to navigate and much faster than the FireStick. Can also install Kodi unlike other streaming devices.,pos
way faster then the firesticks better wifi and comes with voice remote,pos
"Firesticks are cheap, but getting the fire tv meant less buffer time and less lag before watching my shows!",pos
"There are so many advantages to the Fire TV box. It has an Ethernet connection and a USB port. Add a wireless keyboard or flash drive. It's got 4K and it is fast. The fire stick is more reasonable priced but it's not as fast and doesn't have any USB or Ethernet connection. If you have a few bucks more, go for the Fire TV box.",pos
"This device has amazing features and is much better than the Apple TV with a larger range of available apps. One most prominently is Sling TV, that is not supported by the iOS device. Also this version is much better than the Fire TV Stick due to memory and most importantly the ethernet connection. Definitely worth the extra amount over the Fire TV Stick.",pos
Love this product and LOVE Amazon! It replaced my old Fire TV.,pos
This Fire TV works great. I would recommend having Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix. Also if you know anything about KODI you should DEFINITELY add that.,pos
They run way faster then the sticks but I have both,pos
"Awesome device, no cable for...one in every room, plug and play",pos
"My son gave this to me for a B-day gift! Music, movies, shows - and some news. Since I ""cut the cable"" I find that there really is very little news that I can't get elsewhere. No more news-fix required! Works with my Fire Tablet too!",pos
"I already had purchased a Fire Stick, because I am a gadget nut and, well, reasons... *heh*. I decided to move up as part of a cord cutting drive, and this unit really shines. With more compute power and buffering space, it does a really nice job, even on fast moving source material. I also like the voice input.",pos
"This would be a perfect gift for anyone. Easy to use, and we'll put together device.",pos
"firebox is small but fast, runs great and takes no time at all to set up",pos
Had this for 2 days before I cut my cable off. Works great with lots of apps.,pos
"We needed this Amazon Fire- TV in order to watch Amazon Prime on our new smart TV, which we also bought at Best Buy, It was easy to set up and works great, but it didn't come with a connecting cord and the salesman didn't say it needed one. Had to make a trip back next day.",pos
"This system works great, even my five year old son can navigate channels with the remote or voice control. Has parental controls for purchases and viewing. Subscription required for some viewing.",pos
Overall this device is great. No problem with performance and usage. My only fault I think they can advance on is the remote. the current one is nice and sleek but lack the ability to type. Hitting the arrow keys to search for anything is a pin. Second I would add the ability to search for Apps a little more easily. Finally the web browsing is not the best and definitely needs advanced on.,pos
"With the cost of cable being overly costly, I've looked at ways to cut the cable. Adding an HD antenna for local channels, I opted for a FireTv to supplement our tv watching. I already had a Netflix and Hulu streaming account ($20 a mo) so already saving $100+ per mo. Add the benefit of adding numerous free apps...you have a great amount of programming you can enjoy.",pos
"These units get better and better. Lots of apps available. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Why pay 100's of dollars more for a smart tv that is restricted to only a few dozen apps. Amazon has thousands of apps from movies and tv shows, to games and entertainment. Great option for any tv in your house.",pos
I love my Firestick! I dropped my cable a year ago and dont miss it at all!,pos
This product is very useful for watching tv and streaming Netflix and others. Easy to use and easy to hook up. Works great! Good alternative to a smart tv..,pos
I bought this to use for streaming services and it works great,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is a quality product at an affordable price. Less expensive than Apple TV and more capable with a good app eco system. Also able to stream UHD.,pos
I had to buy this item due to the store no longer having the Firestick in the store. Set up was easy and dry easy to use.,pos
Quick and easy to operate also outputs 4K which is great for my Vizio 4k,pos
Awesome fantastic super duper perfecto magnificent great,pos
Really like the Amazon fire tv. It's an awesome product to have for tv lovers!!! Make sure u have strong Wifi!!!,pos
I bought this Best Buy! They are great and hook me up with the best deals :),pos
"I researched several streaming devices but because of my experience with Amazon Kindle Fire and the reviews read for the Fire TV I decided to do the Amazon Fire TV. Set up was easy (the hardest part was opening the remote to put the batteries in!). Once everything was hooked up, the instructions and tips video really helped get everything started. The only negative I will say is that this product did not include the HDMI cable (other brands did) but that was explained on the box and by the sales associate. I enjoyed this so much that I ordered the TV Stick for my bedroom TV. (And have recommended this product to friends and co-workers.)",pos
We ordered the FireTV because it has an ethernet connection for quicker speeds. It also is 4K ready so when we get a 4K TV its ready to stream 4K content from youtube.,pos
Side loaded with kodi and loving no cable bill. Well worth the money.,pos
Much better than fire stick. Downloads much quicker,pos
Excellent alternative to paying the big companies a bunch of money.,pos
It works great for Netflix and amazon streaming I love these boxes,pos
I have owned the fire stick for a few months when I decided to upgrade my TV to 4K and when I did I also upgraded to this Fire TV. It is a. Ice upgrade from the stick picture quality is great (may be the new tv) also runs faster and smoother.,pos
The product works great. If you need help using it just look it up on youtube,pos
This product works great and you can speak right to the remote of what you want,pos
Amazon Fire TV is use easy to use. I has everything you need and tons of apps!,pos
Great piece of equipment. Created rings around Apple TV. With Kodi install ....the best ever!,pos
I was looking at several streaming devices and decided on the Amazon Fire TV. It was a great choice. The device is very fast and has no lag at all. It works great streaming 4k content from Amazon and Netflix to my LG 4k TV. I would highly recommend this product.,pos
Item is as described and I have enjoyed the ease of use,pos
Love this! So easy to use and navagate. Lots of options. Not sure how I went this long without it.,pos
It's a good product to use I suggest people buy it,pos
picked this item up on Halloween nite. Great content and shows-will recommend to friends and family,pos
"I did a lot of research before jumping in and buying the Fire TV. I am glad I took the plunge. I haven't had any issues at all since day one. The speed is great, with no lag, and the recent update just kicked things up a notch. I love it!",pos
"Being that I am already an Amazon prime member, I decided to purchase this to make use of Amazon video. I replaced my Chromecast with the Fire TV and couldn't be happier",pos
I love the Fire TV it's so awesome has so many things on it,pos
excellent product ! this is my second firetv box!!!,pos
"No problems, enjoy being able to watch movies without paying additional fees to rent. Netflix & hulu accounts are available",pos
Works great. TV how you want it watch movies and tv shows anytime.,pos
This is a.great product. Glad I cut the cable wire,pos
great product...will buy again...like it's versility and ease of use,pos
"Not a 5 star. Has a few problems with remote not staying paired, low storage (upgradeable), buffering issues at times but overall not the worst thing out there.",pos
Very easy to set up and use. No issues very simple,pos
"I bought the Amazon Firebox so I could finally get rid of cable. when I think of all the $$ I will save on cable I may buy another one for 2nd tv. A bit challenging learning how to operate it, Once I do I know I will love it. Thanks Amazon",pos
This is one of the best purchases I have ever made pay the little extra and get the fire tv,pos
I have 3 Roku devices and I'm totally impressed by this. Amazon hit it out of the park!,pos
"I already own a Nvidia Shield but needed a cheaper option for my sons room to run Netflix and Kodi. The Amazon Fire TV runs both great, no lag and looks great.",pos
I love this box. It's the best thing out there. I cut my cable completely off. Great savings.,pos
This has been a tremendous item. I'm so glad I did my research and picked this piece for online television.,pos
I had heard of the Amazon fire stick through the Internet. I got to say I'm not disappointed at all with this purchase. It's a wonderful alternative to cable TV and it is saving me alot of money!,pos
Very fast at loading apps and downloading movies and TV shows. Would highly recommend. Also have a firestick and the box is much faster and has more memory.,pos
"Wanted to upgrade from a fire stick, so much faster. Upgraded processor, more ram, and Ethernet makes a big difference.",pos
The best add on to your tv ever!! Shopping streaming all together,pos
It can convert your regular tv into a smart tv. Awesome,pos
I love my fire stick it provided hours of entertainment,pos
"Hands down my favorite purchase lately,if you haven't bought one yet please go get it",pos
"The Amazon fire works great! It's easy to setup, the picture quality is excellent, and the Alexis talk bottom makes searching for stuff easy. We just got rid of our cable, but kept the internet and we've saved over $70 on our bill. Streaming shows on the device is simple, but sometimes the movie or show would get stuck on fast forward. When it does that you have to stop the show then wait two seconds then resume. Other then that little issue, the Fire tv is a great device.",pos
This a great upgrade fir me. Just replaced the fire stick and difference is huge.I love it,pos
"I bought this because I went Amazon Prime and even thought I had an HD TV, Xbox one, PS4 and even my computer i still had problems with Amazon video playing in HD. Magically after purchasing Fire TV the problems disappeared. Way to go Amazon! I bought this over the fire stick because I can add memory. It works great, and the new menu is easier to navigate. I'm not 100% on if it's worth it or not(prime and fire tv). It's like all these streaming services thousands of old videos many b movies that no one cared to watch when they came out. But as a product it works. It's easy to use. And if you like talking to your devices this will be fun for you.",pos
"Works great and is a must have for cord cutters. I switch from an AppleTV and couldn't be happier. Interface is easy to use, processor is ""snappy"", and there is a large list of apps for it.",pos
Provides television options without the cost of cable. Easy to setup and use.,pos
"solid product by amazon, for streaming with various services.",pos
We pay over six $540 a month for Verizon I would never ever pay for cable again all you need is fast Internet I was never the one to sit and watch movies but now since I have the fire stick I love it,pos
"I think it is good compliment to regular cable. If you have subcriptions to the various apps (netflix, amazon, hulu etc.) You may be able to eliminate cable all together. It works seamless with remote. The voice feature is ok but I haven't really gotten the jist of it. Overall good product.",pos
This works almost seamlessly! Very little buffer and runs all apps well.,pos
This product worked excellent right out of the box. Setup was very easy and a no-brainer. I am totally pleased with this product and yes I would recommend it to my friends.,pos
This is a great streaming product. Especially if you already have Amazon Prime.,pos
Faster processor and instant response time. Works as advertised. Way ahead then Roku on features and offering.,pos
Best purchase . Use it daily. Loads fast great buy...,pos
"Works super well, always plays good music and movies",pos
"Love the flexibility to watch what I want! Can switch between locations in the house, and also in our second home!",pos
This thing is fast which is what I like about it. All my older network video streamers seem to get slower (interface),pos
Has everything I wanted. Fast and reliable. Works well with kodi.,pos
Works beautifully. First I connected ethernet to Internet. Discovered wireless capabilities just as good. Great programing.,pos
Fire tv works really well. It was easy to set up. No problems at all.,pos
Great purchase would recommend to a friend easy to use,pos
"Hated it ! You have to purchase everything from Amazon ! Took it back within a couple days! Got the roku ,,,,, way better !",neg
So much difference on viewing all the apps on 4k up scaling was excellent. Unbelievible.,pos
I love it and I don't pay for cable anymore. That's winning all the way around.,pos
"The fire TV is much better than the stick, as it provides more features and is easy to use. I highly recommend it.",pos
Lots of apps and also has Alexa built in. Great HD picture.,pos
This is a good alternative for those who don't like the chromecast. Not great for plex but regular streaming and navigation are very good.,pos
Super fast and easy to use I love this box and it's freatures,pos
"I bought this to have some extra features and compared it to my roku sticks and roku 2,3 and 4. I prefer the roku for netflix and the roku for many maybe more use friendly. However if you are looking for something that can do it all with more capabilities and features the Fire TV wins. I am amazed at what I can do with this little box. If you have not tried one do so.",pos
amazon fir is absolutely the best for streaming movies,pos
amazon fire tv box is awesome i love using netflix in 4k!,pos
We love this and take it everywhere with us for streaming stuff,pos
My son talked me through the job. Easier than I would have expected.,pos
This is a great product for those who have Amazon Prime as you can watch hundreds of movies free. A great addition to any TV,pos
"Amazon Fire is great for people who use Kodi. Great varieties of movies, music, and tv shows you can access.",pos
"I use Prime, Hulu and Netflix for my TV and movie needs. I also own two firesticks already. I wanted one with 4K support for a 4K tv. If u need 4K and want a slightly faster Fire streaming device, go with the player. Otherwise the Firestick is more than adequate for streaming needs.",pos
"Great little box, easy to install and use. You do need to create an amazon account. Great resolution and image.",pos
Easy setup and seamless streaming. Would like to see Amazon upgrade this item to 4K.,pos
"Gift for my parents, easy for them to use! They loved it!",pos
Love my amazon box I'm thinking of buying another.,pos
I had trouble with the device interfering with my internet connection. It would cause my wifi to disconnect. I could not toggle between the device and other devices. After I figured it out it works fine,neg
I like the ease of setup and the apps available in fire tv.,pos
"Really enjoying my product. Clear pictures, great sound quality",pos
very similar items as the stick. able to use a sd card in addition,pos
"We have had a Fire Stick for quite some time that we use for our Playstation Vue subscription. I decided to purchase the Fire TV as a second Playstation Vue device because it has the wired ethernet option, and WiFi isn't a reliably fast enough connection for the streaming services. The Fire TV performs wonderfully, and is much snappier in performance than the Stick even in the menus. Our Apple TV has now been unused for several months.",pos
Love this device and went on to buy 2 as gifts! Hope they love it as much as I do!,pos
Good product for streaming TV shows and Movies even better than the Firestick.,pos
Regulat TV has taken a beck step to the Fire product. Footbal and sports access in general makes this a great option to cable TV.,pos
I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed my Amazon Fire TV. It hooks up to your television seamlessly and provides a wide assortment of viewing options. This device could easily replace your cable television.,pos
I purchased this firetv device so I can stream watch cable channels using PS VUE. The PS Vue interface on this device is very similar to the PS4 version. The only other app I use is Netflix and both apps works great so far.,pos
"Loads TV, movies, applications very smoothly fast. Easy to use.",pos
This is a simple way to get all the channels you want in one location.,pos
It's just ok. Will work but not what I wantedTo controlled by Amazon,neg
Great products from amazon Fire tv 1080p quality,pos
Amazon TV works great when paired with the Kodi app.,pos
Easy to use.Easy to connect with cellphone and tablet to play YouTube. The product said it will upscale to 4k quality but the picture show on the TV is the same as regular product without 4K.,pos
Way better than Apple TV. Very reliable user friendly,pos
The fire tv has been a great upgrade over our 1st gen fire stick. Very much appreciate the 4K streaming abilities.,pos
This is high quality stuff. I recommend it to everyone.,pos
Outstanding Item to have and own when family and friends are visiting,pos
I purchased fire tv because you can download apps onto it so I can use Directv Now. Easy setup and has worked great.,pos
FireTV is the best streaming device. This model have Alexa ,pos
This is amazing can easily move it from computer to TV. My kids love watching movies. Set up in seconds and ready to go.,pos
"An Apple TV was out of the question - lacked access to Prime videos and forced me to rent from iTunes (rarely offers discounted rentals). Leaving me with Roku or the Fire TV. Went with the Fire TV to try something different (owned Rokus before), and have been very pleased. The UI looks great, the voice search is reliable and ability to access so many apps easily makes it easy for others to use.",pos
"Search menus are far more user friendly and we haven't experienced any lockups, which happened frequently with the ROKU devices.",pos
"It's great to watch all your Movies , and stream .",pos
"This device helped in my decision to cut the cord. Works great, abundant material to watch, especially with prime.",pos
I have tried them all and this is the most solid one. Better than Roku,pos
This FireTV has more streaming options than many of the other devices I have tried. It is now a mainstay in my home.,pos
I like that you can choose to use wifi or Ethernet cable,pos
I got a Fire Stick and have noticed that it was a mistake in not having waited for the Amazon Fire T.V. instead. The performance in this Fire T.V. is great. Performs faster and easier than its 1st (Fire Stick). Glad I got it.,pos
A well worth purchase. I got this for my brother and dad for Christmas and they loved it.,pos
Awesome product... I really liked this product....,pos
Great product.......................................,pos
Finds movies and shows quickly. Very easy to set-up,pos
"So far the Amazon Fire is great, with limited issues. We are used to clicking on our DVR and watching all the taped programs we missed. We are still trying to figure out how to do that on the Fire.",pos
"I love the quality on the streaming is my first box I have 2 firesticks, amazing box from amazon.",pos
I love it good bye Apple TV and Roku. A must have for the digital age..!,pos
i love amazon fire tv is the best streaming in the world really recommend,pos
"Didn't really need this with how many options are currently on the market, however my wife received an Amazon Echo for Christmas, decided to give this to her to augment Alexa, My wife is happy, therefore I'm happy:). Works with Alexa btw:)",pos
Excellent overall quality fast easy to setup no hassel. Great amazon selection not to many updates good content. no lag amazing picture quality.,pos
"The first one I received was doa, the second one has worked flawlessly.",pos
Best thing ever I have one in all my rooms in the house,pos
Works like it should. Got it to watch Amazon and Netflix.,pos
"The Fire TV/Stick by Amazon is an amazing product. It has totally reinvented the way you can get premium movies/tv channels, without paying premium price.... I am replacing all of my cable boxes with this product....the savings are incredible!",pos
Works great very happy. Loads very fast and easy to use !,pos
"Was using the fire stick, but they get hot and loose performance. The Fire Tv is faster and so far has had no problems what so ever. It's a little pricey, but you can watch all your internet shows with out interruptions. This unit came with voice commands.",pos
"Good platform, easy to use although a keyboard might prove more helpful that having to ask Alexa.",pos
Great gift idea and reasonably priced. Love the alexa feature,pos
cable package keeps going up. i downgraded package. friend recommended this. in the long run i am saving money. can look at such so many different video programs and movies.,pos
Amazon Fire TV does a good job as a streamer the app market has a good selection of apps. I like the remote. When you use the service they do a good job of making you want to be a Prime member.,pos
"Great streaming device, easy to set up, I love it.",pos
There are plenty of Youtube videos showing how to install Kodi on Fire devices.,pos
is a very good box work very good with wifi with movie tv show and a lot more with family tonight.,pos
I would recommend buying this. Worth the money for all you get.,pos
"Amazing what these little things can do, I Willy continue to buy them again and again.",pos
Awesome device! Turns your tv into a smart tv. Really no need for cable anymore.,pos
"This is a pretty good streaming player, much better than the Roku we have. Only thing I wish this had is the Google Play Store. Other than that it's really good.",pos
"Works great, have the firestick also, seems faster",pos
His streaming device is awesome. So much better than my roku. Options options options is all I have to say,pos
Good interface but not as good as the Apple TV. I got it so we can get our cable TV app on our TV.,pos
Works great! We love it! I would recommend fire TV to anyone.,pos
It is easy to install and upgrade. Love the clarity,pos
Never bought this item at all. So i guess you must have the wrong person,neg
Works awesome. We are cable free thanks to the Fire tv,pos
"Performs much better than the TV Fire Stick gen1 and still able to side load Android apps APK. We were able to load some international apks that allows us to stream TV shows from different countries onto the Fire TV.We could do this with the fire stick to, but occasionally the stream would hang.Not sure if the improved performance is due to upgraded CPU and RAM, or with wired (ethernet) connection (instead of wifi) or both. I got the gen2 TV stick, and even that appear to be performing better. So maybe its more of a upgraded CPU.None of her TV shows have chocked and requires restart yet.",pos
Already purchased fire stick but wanted a box with a little more capability. The android boxes were priced over $200. This box is dual wifi band plus has ethernet. Runs great with no issues. Would recommend,pos
"Works well. Easy to install. Great features include Alexa, connection to Amazon, Netflix, movies I can't find elsewhere, music, and more",pos
"I caught this on the black Friday sale. Works well, way faster than the fire stick.",pos
Perfect for the weekend especially when it rains. Great movie selections,pos
"I just moved and wanted to start fresh without gigantic cable/sat bills. I figured I could use this for netflix, sling tv, and replace the cable clutter and it works wonderfully. CONS: The remote is very basic and it could use a few more buttons, there is no volume or power on/off buttons so you will have multiple remote controls lying around. If you have a smart tv you may not need this as the apps you are looking for may be available on it. PROS: quick, responsive, very sleek and small. Combines everything you need and more.",pos
This new Osmo Mobile is amazing. The quality of it and the way that it turns on its own is just a match going into 2017 as far as the advancement of technology. Definitely recommended!,pos
I expected the drag to be worse. It really isn't..,pos
Love being able to play all original Nintendo games,pos
Product work great. Loaded Kodi to watch movies and have not had any trouble. Definitely recommend this for anyone who has decided to get rid of the cable/satellite.,pos
Very sceptical about getting the amazon tv box but once i decided to get it the family and i were releived that we bought the box. It has many functions and apps including hulu and netflix. A must buy!!!,pos
Great device. Much faster than the Amazon fire stick.,pos
Great products. Works perfect. Get to watch a lot of shows and movies.,pos
"Links to your Amazon Prime account and you can watch thousands of movies, tv shows and get endless apps.",pos
"This product is very user friendly, easy to use. The remote is clean and simple in design.",pos
"Fantastic, I use my fire tv everyday, I tell all my family & friends to buy one. For Christmas I bought them as gifts. This is a must have.",pos
"I've always been a big roku fan and have a few amazon fire sticks, but decided to give this a shot. I am much happier with the Fire TV over the Fire Stick. The processing power allows streaming home videos to be much smoother than the stick and the updated interface is now better than the roku.",pos
"Got this as a step up from the Fire Stick, and can definitely tell the difference. No Lag! Great device. They've recently pushed an update which has cleaned up the interface for the better. We also have ROKU, which is also great.",pos
I really enjoyed the versitility of this item. it works wonderfully.,pos
I love my new fire tv. Don't have to wait for movies to refresh.. awesome!!,pos
Great except it offers no mirroring or airplay support,pos
"I have two of these and three Fire TV sticks. Both products are great. The customization, the store, availability of streaming services, access to Prime benefits, Alexa, the voice remote, these are all great things on both products. Having the ability to plug in external storage and Ethernet makes me a happy user. The additional processing power is noticeable in response time of the interface. I also have a variety of Apple TVs. I appreciate dev access to these devices but that is definitely a poweruser thing.",pos
Easiest money ever spent with instant gratification and still portable if necessary.,pos
I can only hope this will bring the prices of cable tv down. Charter has made it impossible for you to afford television. Thank you Amazon for coming out with a solution!!!,pos
I love Amazon now there's so much functionality especially with video. This works great and the quality is amazing,pos
This product works great and it was a present that she seemed to love.,pos
best on the market you can watch movies from amazon live tv,pos
Decided to purchase this on a friends recommendation and it ws well worth it.,pos
Love it working great on my 4kTV real easy to use.,pos
"awesome little device, I had an apple tv before, this fire stick does the same thing and more for cheaper",pos
You can barely find these in the store now i know why fast smooth tv and movie streaming great for games too,pos
Great device for all your tv and movie streaming.Also this device can play games wow,pos
The Amazon Fire is a great way to watch movies tv shows and sports. I connect directly to my router in my opinion works a lot better than WI-Fi.,pos
"I Love(d) it. I did return it for a Roku. Not for the product quality. I really Liked the Fire TV, the only downfall was the lack of TV Apps that would work with my Cable subscriber. I did have 1 issue with it over heating, After talking with Amazon i could not leave the unit on top of my cable box due to the heat form that unit.",neg
Need a little patience with fast forwarding and pausing . But great picture quality.,pos
I purchased this for my father for Christmas and it is slick and super fast on his 4K television. You can mod and side load apps. Otherwise you would have to be tied into the Amazon eco-system and have Prime in order to enjoy it.,pos
Easy to install. Super easy for everyone to use. Can't imagine tv without it!,pos
Buy this one instead of the fire stick if you want an Ethernet connection. With my internet it runs flawlessly. Great product. Purchasing 2 more for other tvs.,pos
Perfect for cutting the cord on expensive cable and satellite,pos
"I bought this thinking I would be a cord cutter, but the service I have if I do that would make just my internet within $$ of what I pay for both internet & TV. BUT...I love the extra choices that the Fire TV Box gives. SO many choices to try, some free, some free trials and some pay that I really enjoy. Cons...you DO need a very stable internet connection for this device and I wish there was more guidance available on use. Set up was E-Z. Literally 1-2-3. but after that is trial & error to navigate and is why 4 stars not 5.",pos
Fast and easy to use. Interface is user friendly. Even my kids had no issue using this device. No lags for me. Connected wired and seems way faster than the stick. Definitely recommend this item.,pos
Great streaming device with awesome games. Alexa works great,pos
purchase the box so I can save money because I tired of paying Time Warner. Best decision I made,pos
I use this everyday. My entire family enjoys using apps.,pos
I used to stream just about everything I watch. Beats paying a large cable bill.,pos
We bought a second tv so we needed another firetv box. It works great with the services we're using.,pos
Its is a great product.Fast and reliable.Streaming and services are the best,pos
I am loving my Amazon Fire Tv because it gave me the freedom to only pay for what I watch which was one of the things that really bugged me with cable tv. I used to have hundreds of channels available but also paying hundreds of dollars for them and with the Fire TV I just spend the dollar amount that I want.,pos
I upgrade from the fire stick and don't regreted because this one is double the speed and works really good for what I need it.,pos
"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV because it gives you the ability to use streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and many other android based programs. The Amazon OS and GUI is excellent. Smooth and not complicated. The ability to use the microphone on the remote is perfect for anyone as it is very accurate and easy to use. The video streaming is very good, the processors and RAM can give you smooth playback with any media file you can play on it. I highly recommend this box for anyone looking for a streaming device at a great price.",pos
I got this to put kodi on and stream 4K stuff. Works great,pos
"Item was DOA. Reached out to Amazon IT who this happens often. I stand gratification was thrown straight out the window. I returned the item to BB where I purchased the Appel tv. Much better product and works, which is more than I can say for the Fire TV. I give the item a 2 star instead of a 1 because Amazons IT was quick to answer the phone and troubleshoot.",neg
This product is great !!!! I would recommend this to family and friends,pos
i really enjoy this product the costumer service was great on helping me pick the right item and explain it to me well i cont to have great experience at best buy.,pos
This Fire TV is a great way to cut the cord on cable provider or satellite. We are able to stream everything we need and in 4k on our TV. Definitely worth the value.,pos
I bought this for my parents. It works like a charm.,pos
I brought this to upgrade from the fire stick. I am very happy with my purchase. It streams shows and movies very well.,pos
the box is very fast and doesn't have any buffering,pos
I love this Fire TV. Much faster than the fire stick.,pos
This was an upgrade from the fire stick. Works so much faster. Stick is still great and portable but this device is good for bigger places. Works well with weak wifi.,pos
"I have the Roku 4, and new Apple TV, this streaming box is just a good as them. I only got it because I have Amazon Prime (even though you can get eh Amazon Video app for Roku), I wanted the complete experience.",pos
"Like system for live sports, movies ,TV shows and kids shows..",pos
Sets itself up. Has everything I need. Will buy several more. Far better than the stick.,pos
"I just look at the instructions,buy some cable wires,make sure you have internet,walahhh",pos
"The Amazon Fire TV box hooks to cable modem easily and is very user-friendly. Great for Amazon Prime members. The only issue is that there is not enough 4K content out there and, in my opinion, does not warrant the price as opposed to the more portable Amazon Fire TV stick. Yes, the box has a faster processor and more RAM than the stick, but for content, I've had NO PROBLEM with the stick and it's cheaper.",pos
I love it it works like a charm. I would recommend it to friends and family.,pos
Fire TV is great to watch our favorite movies and shows on. We have great wi-fi but some things play better than others on the Fire. The buffering when it does this will get on your nerves but all in all we like Fire TV.,pos
"Easy to use as it is intuitive. Love the Alexa remote. You can just say ""Alexa Tom Hanks""and it will pull up all the Tim Hanks movies available.",pos
Runs smoother then the fire stick. Love the idea of picking and paying for only the channels I want.,pos
easy to setup and use. with low cost subscriptions you can get great shows and movies,pos
"This is the best smart tv box out there, I've tried Roku, and I'm not a big fan, also have seen Apple TV, and used to own a google chrome cast, but the amazon tv is the easiest to use, and I think is the best bang for the buck! Even if you have a smart TV I recommend buying an Amazon tv box. Watching any Netflix, or Amazon prime videos is easy, loads super fast, and works great. Especially if you download the Kodi app on the box!! I am a loyal customer as I have 4 Amazon tv boxes in my home!",pos
Awesome product it is better than the stick highly recommended,pos
"I've hooked it up but just haven't signed up for the service yet, So we'll see.",pos
I love this device I use it everyday for all tv uses.,pos
Good if you like movies and have prime membership.,pos
5 star product would recommend it to anyone who is looking to get rid of cable,pos
"Amazon TV Box has the best bang for the buck. No other devices can match performance and price this offers. Great for gaming, movies, shows",pos
It reboots sometimes but it beats paying cable bill,pos
We are so happy with our fire stick that we rushed back to Best Buy to another on for our friends.,pos
"I have a hard time navigating the menus and use is not intuitive,",neg
"Great product, a much better alternative to the fire stick (which is slightly cheaper). Streams better, less buffer periods, and compatible with all programs I have used on it. Great purchase.",pos
"I decided to get the Fire TV after one of my remote Media Centers failed. With my movie collection on my server, I was able to install Kodi on the Fire TV and continue to stream my movies over the network. Add in our subscription to Netflix, HBO GO, Stars Play, and Amazon Prime membership, the Fire TV offers a wide range of entertainment.",pos
"Since the most recent update, we really like the fire tv. We like that the fire tv includes an alexa remote since we have our lights connected to our dot. Before watching a film, we can dim the lights using the remote. The interface of the fire tv obviously emphasizes Prime video so it may be useless for those non-Prime users; however, Fire tv has a lot of apps that you can use. I was disappointed that VUDU was not on fire tv, though.",pos
Terrific purchase that was enabled with an Amazon Prime membership. We just love watching TV shows and movies in the privacy of our home using the Amazon Fire TV device. Simple to setup...less than 5 minutes and we were on our way.,pos
Store is very clean never takes longer the an hour for my items to be ready for pick up.. device works great has received the lowest price,pos
Amazon Fire is easy to setup and easy to use. The user interface is friendly.,pos
Great product very easy to use. Very good for programs such as Lodi.,pos
"We have 2 Roku 3s, and we like the Fire TV better. It works so much better with our SlingBox...you don't have to go through your cellphone. Our Rokus freeze up frequently, but the Fire TV has only done this once. (So far!) We will probably buy a second one for our bedroom and move the Roku 3 to a guest bedroom.",pos
My husband wanted the fire box and we are glad we got it.,pos
i got tihs so i can watch hulu and netflix and it is pretty fast,pos
Works great with our 4K tv. Upgraded from firestick and can really see the difference,pos
"My kids love this little fire, they can watch whatever movies for number of times wi",pos
"I love how this box allows me to combine my Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and a bunch of other useful hubs in one. It's user friendly and the voice remote is a lifesaver. No more typing in search boxes!",pos
Love it easy to use just talk and your song or movie comes up,pos
This fire has a lot more options than the previous one I had purchased,pos
We have enjoyed using the Amazon Fire tv. It is similar to Apple TV and roku but nice if you have a 4K tv and Amazon prime,pos
Love this product. Very fast and no buffering lag.,pos
Easy to use and easy to navigate through everything.,pos
"The Amazon Fire TV is great. I enjoy watching the news, movies and sports with it",pos
I prefer this than the fire stick because it doesn't freeze like the stick does.,pos
This device is amazing. It has all the latest tv apps as well as cable channel apps. It definitely will cut your cable bill in half,pos
Nice work good look al my movies work great on my tv,pos
"My wife and I have been cordcutting for a while with a Roku TV on one TV and a PS4, I decided to try the Amazon Fire TV...WOW this device is beyond awesome. I live the alexa integration to find movies. the only way it would be better is if Alexa could tune to channels on PlayStation Vue. The ability to clone my Android phone to this device is great as well. I would very highly recommend this device",pos
Very similar to the fire stick but it seems a bit faster when downloading.,pos
Item as described!!!! Excellent media center !!! Esasy to install !!!,pos
"i purchased this in hopes of making my existing tv a smart tv, honestly i was kind of disappointed. for starters the remote quite a few times lost sync with the box and i had to download the fire tv app to reset the box. second it froze constantly in the middle of using amazon prime it would freeze up. now this might just have been the bad one in the batch, i dont know but i returned it and are looking for something different.",neg
I love streaming tv with this device works very smoothly have had no glitches whatsoever,pos
I love it because it give me access to all my favorite shows,pos
"I'm so happy with this product, so many channels and best of all no more cable company. Just to give you all an idea, I was PAYING about $$$$125.00 plus, plus, plus amonth, in cable, that's about $$$1500 plus, plus, plus a year. So now I with NETFLIX, AMAZON PRIME & SLING TV going to pay about $40.00 a moth, that's about $500 per year..... Plus there is other goodies that comes with it. Excellent streaming capabilities never lose it signal. Excellent product AMAZON",pos
streaming is flawless on this device. my 4k tv looks great when sending video from this firetv.,pos
This is a great media device. Mostly use it for XBMC/KODI but has plenty of power for other functions,pos
love it nice and clean powerful tv box fast shipping from best buy all the time,pos
"This is a very capable player. It is comparable to the Roku 4 or AppleTV. There are a few caveats though. The device works best if you have Amazon account, preferably an Amazon Prime account. It allows you to access the Amazon Video library, download apps, and use Alexa voice search. Unfortunately, there is an additional annual fee for the service. There is a free option, but it limits the ability of the device. The device also lacks pos YouTube support. You're redirected to a website like interface to view videos. With YouTube beginning to roll out 4K content, it makes you wonder why this device doesn't have a dedicated YouTube app to showcase the 4K ability. If you have an Amazon Prime account, this device works very well. Otherwise, I would recommend doing some research, such as looking at the Roku 4, which has a more well-rounded set of features.",pos
"I mostly bought this to give me Amazon Prime with HDR as it was not available on my Nvidia Shield. It does a great job, and has excellent performance and speed with the menus and such. Very intuitive and easy to use. That all said, the Nvidia shield received an update today that adds Amazon Prime, so it will probably become my device of choice again.",pos
Very easy to install and use. Great for testing whole family. The remote is easy to use and very easy to memorize,pos
great streaming box for watching great movies. amazon tv is fast and fluid to use. they have alot of movies.,pos
"The Amazon fire stick is everything that I expected and more. I loved the pricing and the fact that all fire sticks are voice activated. Easy to navigate through 1000,s of free movies and games.",pos
A great way to stream very simple lots of apps easy to maneuver through great piece of equipment.,pos
Perfect to watch anything I need small and to the point,pos
"I bought this hoping to get a responsive android streamer, but was disappointed with the performance and the ""4k"" that was somewhat limited. I decided to return this and get an Nvidia Shield, which offers more value, instead.",neg
so far so good I own this for almost a year and no freeze when Im watching a movie via stream,pos
Great product. Would recommend to a friend. Love it love it love it.,pos
Awesome alternative to cable television. Being able to save $180 a month is worth the one time cost!,pos
"Fire TV helps me navigate several viewing sources which helped me end my relationship with my satellite provider. I'm now spending $35 per month & have access to sports, movies, etc.",pos
I love all of the different apps that are available. I have a 12mpb internet speed and have not had any issues.,pos
It allows us to watch movies and stuff that we normally would not get to see.,pos
"Very simple setup. Within minutes I was using and discovering some fun entertainment. I am not an Amazon Prime member yet, but I expect being a member will open even more wonderful entertainment.",pos
I like it better than Apple TV. It's easy to use and get lot more apps,pos
Great product to pull yourself away from cable. Sling app on it for your sports,pos
"Wonderful selection of movies, TV series, etc. Variety of programming has something for everybody",pos
Working good and easy operation. Better than stick,pos
Ok I would not be recomend this product at all okk,neg

"Watch what I want when I want, No more Cable Bill.",pos
If you don't have cable this is a good thing to have. Great product. & you can even jail break it.,pos
This is a major upgrade from the fire stick. Works extremely well no lag. Would definitely recommend to anyone that has Amazon prime.,pos
"The fire stick has more than enough to offer in entertainment, something for every one's taste. The programming is not disappointing. The equipment is inexpensive and you.have control of any other expenses like subscriptions. Your bill will be far less than a cable bill and you will have more enjoyment from the programs. The only thing that needs to be done is having local channels available,. without an antenna which may or may not help reception.. I also miss OWN.",pos
I recently purchased this product. I am satisfied with this Amazon firestick. Good for 4K picture,pos
Great buy with lots to do on this product highly recommend,pos
I love my fire tv i like it better than cable because it cost last great to have in every room.,pos
This gadget is amazing - you can watch movies from 1958 if you are into that era.,pos
"This is a good tool to use... I however, would suggest that you upgrade to the better version.. I did, and I like it much better.",pos
Not knowing much about the fire tv I did my research and when I got it home it was even better than I expected!,pos
I enjoy amazon TV and is easy to use that my young children can navigate it without my help.,pos
It's hard to give a review cause it's stuck on Amazon home screen. It might be a good product but I don't know,pos
I got this for directvnow Hulu cbs omg a lot of different apps it was time to cut the cord I love it,pos
This product needs a bit more info to explain how it works and the set up. It is all quite easy once we had a neighbor over to help and ro explain. We are still exploring how this works for us but so far it is almost too good to be pos -- especially with the price!We are hooked on 'the night manager',pos
Love my firetv box... who needs cable. Even better then the stick!,pos
Pretty good Will recommend it to friends and family,pos
Amazon fire tv has everything you will ever need in terms of streaming. I only carry local cable channels since purchasing this box,pos
"Worth the purchase, simple to use and easy to set up",pos
"Had the Fire Stick before this and liked it, but felt load times were a little slow due to less ram and a worse processor. This FireTV is excellent! Load times are extraordinarily and it is lightning fast. Would recommend this to everyone.",pos
"Ive always used apple devices, but this little gadget is full of surprises",pos
"I purchased this since my smart TV could not connect to WiFi anymore. Overall it works well. Was a little expensive, but the fire TV sticks were all sold out.",pos
Great deal and wonderful product. Saving money on cabls,pos
I have 2 of those and work great and fast is a Bluetooth.,pos
"amazon fire tv, i use it a lot, it is worth the price it cost..",pos
Great option for watching tv without a cable subscription.,pos
We have gotten rid if cable and just use the fire sticks. What a big savings from the high price of cable.,pos
I just do know how I can live without my new firestick! It's so easy to use and so much to see because of this!,pos
"Video quality from the Amazon Fire TV box is amazing. I have many other streaming devices from Amazon Fire stick first gen and Nexus player, this device is head and shoulders above the rest. Highly recommended.",pos
"Watching movies listening to music, reading books. All for free and easy to do.",pos
I got this to use in my living as im cutting the cable cord. Works great with WIFI and i can put my tv any where!,pos

I bought this for as a gift for my daughter. she love it!,pos
this item is great does not take any space plus has some great features.,neg
"FireTV with the option for 4K opens the possibility to a new world. Not to mention that the android based software opens the door to use apps beyond the amazon store. if you have a prime account, your experience is greatly enhance. Good wireless connection another plus.",pos
Its a greatproduct halpy i bought and im happy to use it,pos
I absolutely love my firebox. Its convenient and easy to use. Great for watching movies with the kids and family. I have not had any problems with it and Alexa is a great addition.,pos
This is an awesome product. Great for watching shows and movies!,pos
I've been waiting for the ability to expand memory and its here! Along with that Alexa voice feature and an improved graphics engine Fire TV is headed in the right direction.,pos
I have recently purchased a 4K tv and wanted to get the best experice out of watching anything this fire tv has great screen quality and sound with no delays,pos
This is a great device and it streams better than the usual fire stick.,pos
"Works great, a gift for my daughter for Christmas.",pos
There is so much content out there that is free and he fire is easy to use to watch it.,pos
"This is the second Amazon Fire TV device I have purchased, which I bought as an addition for another TV in my home. This device is great because it allows you to connect to so many different TV source (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Sling TV, etc.). Also, the processing speed with this device is great and a little better than the firestick that I have.",pos
We needed something to be able to stream all of our subscription services. A friend told us a fire stick would be perfect since we have prime and this turned out perfect!!!,pos
This works great and allows us to watch tv movies and shows when it is convenient for us. Love it.,pos
We love the voice command remote. Easy setup. Kids and adults can operate it.,pos
I was looking for the slingbox app. Not many devices seem to support watching slingbox on a TV (not sling TV). This worked great!,pos
This was exactly what we needed. No if it could only make me a sandwich.,pos
"Love this device. I have a 16 month old that is hard set to get to nap and go to bed. Currently still on a vacation, and have been very pleased with the ease of putting on Sesame Street on the hotel tv via hbogo. no little tablet or phone needed, and has perfect picture quality",pos
He loves it and can watch anything he wants on his own tv,pos
"It's perfect for me, my husband and my daughterthere are so many apps we downloaded, Sling, Nick Jr, Disney, CNN etc.If you're looking for the end all answer to cut your cable TV service, FireTv does not have things like live CNN, AMC and other cable stations (yet), but you could purchase a subscription for Sling TV (Google it) which has ala-carte live TV services. Something Apple is promising to deliver. If you have a current cable subscription, you can get things like HBO and Netflix streamed to your box if you are already paying for it in your home cable subscription. Your provider ""passes through"" the HBO, Netflix, etc",pos
We tried the roku 3 and by far the fire box is way better in our opinion.,pos
I absolutely love my firestick. The possibilities are limitless.,pos
Watching lots of shows without any issues. Easy to setup,pos
The device has provided our family with numerous hours of TV watching without the high monthly costs of cable,pos
Love it and have never had any issues with the fire tv box.,pos
"This Fire Tv box is great. Bye bye cable, hello savings. I'm glad I purchased this item.",pos
"This was supposed to be a gift for Christmas, but after I bought it , I had to keep it for myself.",pos
Great to group all your program app into one device.,pos
I have used this everynight since I bought it to catch all my favorite shows and movies. I am so glad I bought this product!!!!!!,pos
Usually use fire tv stick but got this one for 4K and faster speeds and it does not disappoint,pos
Spectrum works with Roku and smart cast app so we had to return and get a roku. Don't buy if you want to stream Spectrum to TVs without a cable box.,neg
Has a faster processor than the firestick and has the ability for expandable memory. Works great.,pos
I wanted to find a way to stream The Grand Tour and the Fire TV works great. Our first streaming experience- very easy to use with Amazon Prime and high speed internet.,pos
I can't seem to be able to hook it up with my internet connection. I will be returning it to the store.,neg
"Its Really amazing device, i really like it. its working flow less.",pos
"Great entertainment devicegood brand, quality and price!",pos
My wife and I use this all of the time to stream movies.,pos
"For me, the Amazon Fire TV is an amazing way to hook up with my favorite Netflix and Amazon Prime shows or explore other streaming sources. So easy to use. No more ""hunt and peck"" input for searching for the show I want to watch. I simply push a button, say the name of my fav show and it comes up on the screen. I love it so much, I bought one for both of my TV's!",pos
Enjoyed it so much on one tv we decided to put itOn an additional tv in bedroom. Will be phasing out of DIRECTV soon.,pos
Makes.an old TV new again. Wonderful if you are a prime member.,pos
"Awesome product! Not a tech savvy person, Easy to use...from setup to uploading and watching my picks of movies, not disappointed in the lease. Saved me money on my cable bill too",pos
ok feature. Operating instructions easy.Alexa feature is plus,pos
works perfect for my 4k tv and the voice command comes in handy,pos
Great product works great and the application will work with the future updates to keep up the great work and I have the same info.,pos
I already had the Amazon Firestick. The FireTV is faster and even better!,pos
This is a great product to purchase I love that you can watch whatever out there too watch with out leaving the comfort of your own home,pos
"I like how the Amazon Fire TV works consistently. With it being able to be hardwired into my existing network, it fires up and works seamlessly.",pos
Very pleased.Affordable price.Great buy.easy to manage.,pos
Has media streaming capabilities but also Alexa smart home functions. Good value for the price. This version has 4K streaming capability.,pos
Great product! Easy to use! New update to the UI is really nice too!,pos
a high quality experience with more choices all the time.,pos
"Best thing we ever purchased! Amazon TV is awesome, best move we ever made. we cut the chains from Directv and don't even miss it. There are so many things to watch and there are in-app purchases as well if you want to expand your viewing pleasure. still cheaper than Directv or cable. Highly recommend this.",pos
Bought the fire box for main Television in house and it works great,pos
This is one of the best devices out right now! I love it!,pos
The fire stick provides excellent 4k quality and is easy to use,pos
"Great purchase. Really worth it if you have Netflix, Hulu and stream other things to phase out cable. Easy to use.",pos
This has expanded my viewing and allowed me to see movies that I had forgotten.,pos
"I liked the Fire TV so much, I purchased a second one.",pos
The product worked great and easy to setup. Took the product back as the Fire Stick was all I needed,pos
Good streaming device. Simple interface and sleek design make it easy on the eyes. Voice remote works great (much better then phone) when it comes to searching. Would buy again.,pos
Best purchase ever. Would recommend to anyone. It's the best,pos
I would recommend this product to anyone that is interested at this time.,pos
Functions as its supposed to good deal. Great item for ur tv and a great goft for my dad,pos
"I like the Amazon Fire TV. It was easy to set up and begin using. We used a friend to help us load the various sites we were interested in, but I have since added some on my own and the set up was not difficult. I also own a Roku connected to another television but I prefer the Amazon Fire TV as it is easier to use.",pos
This works great and provides me tons of options with apps.,pos
Purchased this for voice command capabilities which work great. Great product.,pos
This item is one of the best add-ones known to man. You can download almost every app to use on your TV. There is always updates to make sure it works properly. I've never had an issue with the Fire Stick.,pos
"I purchased this device because I was tired of Direct Tv, Dish Network, and Time Warner increasing my bills with hidden charges. This device lets you dictate when and what you want to watch for free if you do some research. Yes this device is worth the effort it takes to set it up. It has let me say good bye to my monthly tv bill.",pos
"It's not as user friendly as advertised, but I guess it works ok",neg
Faster than the firestick I definitely would buy another one much better than Google Chrome,pos
I am no longer sitting alone in the basement watching Netflix using the kid's Xbox connection. I can watch Netflix upstairs and still remain somewhat involved in what the rest of the family is doing!,pos
"This was purchased because every time I would try to stream something from my tv, it would be laggy. This solved my problem. Easy set-up and user friendly.",pos
"I know not everyone wants to read a direct comparison to an Apple TV rather than a review on the moerits of this device, but I have owned both and stuck with the Apple TV instead of this.The Apps I used (DirecTV Now, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video) choked and buffered much more often, or froze completely. The wifi reception was also sub par.The remote is good, and I prefer the batteries approach to Apple's rechargeable one. Everything else though, the Apple TV seemed to do better.My two cents. Still a solid streaming device, and the price is better than Apple's. I would make the decision based on how plugged into Amazon's ecosystem you are vs. Apple's.",pos
Connected hardwire to the home network. Added Playstation Vue. Very Happy. Some limits on live sports can be a problem.,pos
"Love, love, love the Amazon Fire Stick! Works really well and is easy to use!",pos
Bought as a gift and very easy to use. Everyone was happy!,pos
Runs flawlessly...Love The Fact It's Not Just Wi-Fi Enabled,pos
Great product to watch shows online. Only downside is that you can't stream/cast computer screens easily like a chrome cast can. Being able to talk into the app or remote makes it really easy to navigate the system to find things fast,pos
Works great we are Amazon prime so love the shows ! I am using this with wireless .,pos
This item is so great. I love it. I bought 2 of this before and gave it to my family member and they loved it too.,pos
"If looking to get an all in one box, this one works great!",pos
"It has an excellent collection of apps, interface is really smooth and no hick ups.",pos
So many products on the market. This by far is saving me almost $250 a month on my Comcast bill!,pos
I myself have never used it but my grandson does all the time. He said the voice activation works very good and he likes it a lot. He's going on 8 years old and knows all about it.,pos
I wish I didn't wait to get this. It is so much faster than using a DVD player for apps like Hulu and Netfliz. Plus the voice serach is handy.,pos
"Works great! Get all my shows and movies. Even gets my hockey channels. 4K, 1080p, HD, and standard viewing options. So worth it, i bought 2 more!!!",pos
My primary interest in streaming (this was new to me) was to stream The Grand Tour on Amazon Prime. I figured an Amazon device was the easiest way to do this. And I was correct. The Fire TV is easy to use and works great. I have fast internet (50-60 mpbs download) so I have no complaints about picture quality.,pos
Better performance and more options that my firestick. As it should for the extra cost and added size. Still a nice compact little package though. Very happy with this purchase and runs all of the programs I use very well. Expandable storage is a huge plus!,pos
Very easy installation and works great! I'd highly recommend it.,pos
"works like a charm, easy to use, faster product. highly recommend.",pos
Love having easy access to my amazon prime account. Easy setup!,pos
I suggest this to anyone looking to watch Netflix and Hulu simple.,pos
I looked at the reviews between the stick and the box. I choose the box because it connects to the Ethernet.,pos
Friends were pleased with gift will be buying one for their family.,pos
"This allows us to watch what we want to watch ,when we want to watch it.",pos
"The firestick with voice remote has tamed the TV again, making watching enjoyable and easy. My wife is the one who is really sold on it, as she had become frustrated with most of the gadgets I've brought into the house. This one she won't part with!",pos
"Best product out there, worth buying all day, wouldnt pass on it",pos
Liked this product so much that I have purchased two more and plan on buying more for all our televisions.,pos
I really like the Fire TV. We've had one in our living room for several years and I bought this one for my wife for Christmas to put in the bedroom. Great utility and very easy to sue.,pos
"Bought this for my dad to watch Netflix, and it works very well. Easy to use, which is a bonus",pos
I got the Fire TV so that I can watch Directv Now. It works really well and is right up there with the Roku Premiere + that I also own.,pos
"This does what is suppose to do, and I haven't had not over issue with it... I give it a thumbs up!",pos
This amazon fire tv was a great gift. many movies at your finger tips,pos
I am very happy with my Amazon Fire TV. I set my 19 year old daughter to install it and she had it up and running in a matter of a couple minutes.,pos
Bought this to run the Kodi app. It's awesome!!!!!,pos
This was a Christmas gift andmy son is pleased with it!,pos
This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it. I was undecided between the Fire stick or the Fire TV and since a coworker has the Fire TV and loved it I went with the Fire TV as opposed to the stick - especially since there is more memory in the Fire TV (the TV is about 50.00 more but worth it),pos
"My girlfriend and I have essentially become cord cutters so we had to find a box top set so that we could watch our Netflix, Directtv, and HBO. We got this because it was recommended by a friend. The user interface is simple and it works great if you have Amazon Prime. The main issue we have is when we forget to put it to sleep, which i recommend you do, is that the apps stall and don't start up right away. I'm not sure if it's the apps or the Fire TV itself. Its bothersome at times but it's nothing that we have to get replaced.",pos
I tried this out for a few weeks and it does not have nearly the programs that it says it does. I would rather pay for Netflix or Hulu.,neg
This product is no different than the fire stick in my opinion it does have more memory and an option where you can add an SD card to it but other than that it is the same as a firestick no reason to pay twice the money for this box,neg
Pretty easy to use once we went thru it with our grandkids. We are not technically savvy.,pos
"The Amazon Fire TV box is better than using the ""smart"" software built-in on any Blu-ray player or TV I've owned. Those brands include Sony, Mitsubishi, and Samsung. It is very responsive when navigating menus and making selections. If you're not an Amazon Prime member, be prepared to have that in your face - this is an Amazon device after all. The remote is minimalist in style and has the mic built-in for speaking to Alexa, which is a plus in my book.",pos
Fire tv loads faster than the stick. Works great with amazon prime.,pos
Love that Prime membership allows me to see all other movies...bye bye Netflix,pos
This device streams available content smoothly. Plan to buy another one for children.,pos
The set up was quick and simple. The voice commands work well.,pos
This item works well. Will help you avoid those monthly cable fees,pos
Researching all of the like products I find that this product best ties in with other sevices i use. I would recommend to my friends and family,pos
Great product. I would highly recommend with the increased storage and ungraded firmware.,pos
"Upgraded from an older model AppleTV to this, couldnt be happier with the amount of features and apps available. Voice search is surprisingly great!",pos
Absolutely best amazon product ever! Very easy to navigate. Love everything about it.,pos
"This was purchased to replace the fire stick. If you're debating between the fire stick and the fire TV, get the fire tv box. Waiting for the fire stick to power on and connect to wifi, or trying to type anything with a directional pad wastes too much time!",pos
"It was a gift, so i can really only comment on the quality of the box. It was very square and well proportioned. The cellophane was slick but not overly so. Overall a decent tactile sensation.",pos
"Bought this for a raffle gift, and everyone wanted to win it. I personally have one too, and love it.",pos
So easy to use my parents can even figure it out good quality,pos
"My first one didn't work, but was easily exchanged at Best Buy. New one works great, I watch streaming tv on it thru the PS Vue app. The Fire box is much quicker and smoother than the Fire stick.",pos
I was able to catch this thing on sale Black Friday for $70. It could possible be the best $70 I have ever spent. Everyone should own a amazon fire tv!,pos
This thing works pretty good. That is unless you are trying to stream Directv Now reliably. Probably not Amazon's fault though. Everything else works flawlessly.,pos
"This item allowed me to turn my tv into not only a smart tv, but a game console. Is great for family games.",pos
Good upgrade to the Firestick. Alexa search works well so you can quickly find titles.,pos
I love this product i have several flat screen tvs and i have bought several of these fire sticks as i unlock the stick to put kodi on it so i can watch all the latest and greatest shows for free including im movie theaters and live tv i would hogjly recommend this product especially if u know how to unlock the stick ;),pos
"this is a fantastic item, love the simplicity of its use",pos
I love being able to choose what I want to watch!!,pos
Use it everyday...sign up for amazon prime and watch almost anything..,pos
Wish we could get some free stuff with it. Might have to get amazon prime to get more stuff,pos
Fire tv is to Android users as to Apple TV to Apple users. It's fast and never has any issues streaming,pos
"Excellent purchase, recommended to all my friends, and purchased another on for my other TV.",pos
Absolutely great would buy over and over again excellent for streaming,pos
I have cancelled Direct TV and I am using this plaform for personal entertainment.......love it and love the fact that I don't have one those big DirectTV DVR monstrosties sitting in front of my TV anymore which I was paying a monthly fee for. Love Amazon Prime platform there is so much free content available if your a Prime member. I choose this over apple TV because apple charges for everything and can get expensive like Direct TV.,pos
If you plan to watch live TV. Get this one.If not fire stick is good.Also get this if you plan to install other apps as it has upgradeable memory,pos
"Kodi fans get the TV! Even if you have the stick, upgrade. You'll be happy you did. Very cool item!!!!",pos
purchased for Kodi and 1st time setup was little bit time taking process. after that everything good.. getting 4k resolution and flexible to carry anywhere.. buffering is good when you connected through internet cable instead of wifi,pos
Buy it. These are awesome. Love them! So much can be done with them. Best on the market. Worth the extra over the fire tv stick.,pos
"Best purchase I've made in a while. This thing is fun for the whole family, really came in handy with the recent storms we had. Every night is a movie night with this",pos
It gives me viewing options that I love and the grand kids love playing the games,pos
"Very smooth operating system and easy to use for Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc",pos
What else can I say? This is an awesome little device and is leading me towards cutting out cable altogether.,pos
"Easy set-up, We figure that we can cut our cable bill almost $80 - $100 a month by using this. Also getting more channels we will watch, instead of paying for the cable companies choices that we don't care for.",pos
Couldn't be happier works as expected and price was fair.,pos
The fire tv has been a cool utility to add to the entertainment department in our household. Much more responsive than the stick... hardly any lag. Continuous updates from Amazon keeps the UI fresh & ever evolving content is a plus.,pos
This stick runs fast and smooth with alot less lag than the original. If you want to the best the Nvidia shield 2017 is the best.,pos
what an amazing device. super fast in comparison to the fire tv stick. best streaming device available in my opinion!,pos
This is a very good product and excited to use it.,pos
Bought the unit as it has apps that allow for linking my Sling TV device and freeing up my IPad and Apple TV all in one box.,pos
"What can I say, it saves you money. It's a no brainer. Destroys the any other media streamer on the planet. Put your dollars into this device if you want quality.",pos
Best streaming device. For the price better than Apple TV,pos
The Amazon Firestick with voice remote is very easy to set up and very easy to use. The voice remote makes finding what you want to watch very easy.,pos
Setup was much simpler than originally planned and easy to install on non-smart tv,pos
I purchased this for my bedroom since I have the stick downstairs close to my Wifi router and have had no issues with it. This is even better than the stick and has no buffering or lag issues whatsoever for the normal things I watch and stream. Highly recommended!,pos
I purchased the amazon Fire Tv as a way to save money by canceling my cable subscription which was around $150 a month. I used it on my old Samsung tv and purchased a subscription to Netflix around $10 plus high speed internet $40 and side loaded Kodi free for a total saving's of $100. so far I've purchased around 5 amazon fire tv's.,pos
I love it because it saves me money. Easy to use. Great value.,pos
"Wasn't sure about getting this or the fire stick, but read this works a lot better. Glad i purchased this.",pos
Well worth the money. Bye-bye cable company bills.,pos
I enjoy this product . I own 2 in addition to the fire sticks in the kids room.,pos
"I've had the Fire Stick for awhile, and thought it was just fine, why spend more for the Fire TV? Well now that I have the Fire TV, I'm glad I bought. It is faster than the Stick, and works better in every way. Love the voice command! Get one!",pos
My 3rd Amazon Fire TV (for different rooms) and it is such a great product. Much easier to navigate then the built in smart TV functions for watching other apps and it is much more responsive for searching for shows using the voice controlled search function.,pos
I strongly recommend this item a lot of things to do,pos
Love the abundance of media outletsAvailable.love it!,pos
Fastest product I have ever used highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a lag free experience,pos
I love the many programs you can get from the many apps.,pos
Way to set up. Easy to use. Add on apps are easy to install as well,pos
I use it every day. 4k shows like the Grand Tour look impressive. Set up is easy.,pos
Love it I can stream all the stuff that I want to see. Catching up on the shows that's no longer on tv is so cool. I also have amazon prime so I can watch certain movies. Best purchase ever.,pos
Better than the fire stick crystal clear perfect gift for someone,pos
Great item to have. Consolidate all your apps to watch shows. No issues at all.,pos
"All the important Apps are loaded on this HDMI device. I can even side-load other Apps and Games that are not already installed on it. Nice BASIC slim remote control that's not loaded with a lot of control buttons. Easy to operate. The remote is also voice activated (I use this feature for checking weather). I use this device for watching Live TV from PlayStation Vue (much cheaper than cable or satellite TV). I like the Fire TV box much better than the Fire TV stick....it's more stable and stronger (has quad core processor, the stick is dual core). If you have strong wifi the stick maybe okay, I kept experiencing buffering issues with the stick. The Fire TV box has an Ethernet port, mini SD slot, and USB port (the stick doesn't). You will need to setup an Amazon account to use the device, but you don't have to put credit card information on it if you don't want to. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is extremely difficult to put batteries in the remote control - VERY difficult to open it. Despite that, IMO, it's worth the extra cost.",pos
This is super simple to set up and use. The hardest part is using your tv provider info to gain access to some of the channels. This requires a bit of patience since you have to log in and enter codes and wait for emails to accomplish.,pos
In my opinion the fire tv is definitely one of the best streaming devices out there with its awesome performance and easy to use.,pos
Love it best purchase especially if you have someone to program it for you!,pos
Easy setup and the Echo voice activated searches is a nice touch. Good set of applications as well.,pos
Works as expected. Great for watching tv without the need for cable or satellite,pos
Excellent streaming device offered at a reasonable price.,pos
Way better than the amazon stick. I use it for kodi,pos
"Very pleased with the Fire TV. I thoroughly researched alternative products before deciding on the Fire TV. The unit is fast and I enjoy the integration with Amazon Video, Netflix and other streaming services. My only issue is that the box is very simplistic cosmetically as compared with Apple TV or G Box. Other than that this is a great product.",pos
Fire stick from amazon very good product. .very nice,pos
This device is the perfect way to consolidate all your favorite TV apps. Easy to use. Easy to set up.,pos
This is a great product..and best buy makes it easy.I cant think of any other product that can fullfill the purpose of my use..Awesome,pos
The ability to expand the memory ease of use and 4K comparability make this a versital 1 package entertainment tool.,pos
"Easy to setup, and install. Only took a few minutes to hookup and watching movies. Simple to use, and navigate.",pos
Originally I bought the stick. I ended up giving the stick to my friend because I had bought this as a present for my brother and helped him set it up. It is extremely fast so I bought one for myself. The fire tv is fantastic for watching anything,pos
Only one reason people buy these i for kodi. It's a great device and i love it i hated paying 100 dollars for it just because the sticks were sold out due to resellers,pos
The firetv is so easy to use. Plug it in and go. Affordable & lots of great apps,pos
The fire TV is way better than the firestick. I hate that the firestick only works with Wifi and I hated all the buffering. I got the firetv and all of the buffering issues were eliminated.,pos
Loved the box does exactly what is supposed to do stream movies all day long,pos
This device does a great job of streaming from all of your accounts.,pos
I had a 3 year old Roku stick which was a lot better than broadcast antenna service but with the Roku stick I often waited through long pauses while the data was buffering. The Fire TV (2015 model) is a small box on my flat screen TV stand which provides a fast friendly interface to fast streaming entertainment and almost no buffering waits. I like the small tapered remote control which is light and easy to hold and point while browsing the many options. Amazon offers Prime members a very large array of entertainment and learning selections to enjoy.,pos
l love my fire tv. liked it somuch i purchased a firestick formy other tv. i use them every day!,pos
Recommend to anyone interested.....................,pos
I've always been a Roku user but when Directv Now came out recently and wasn't available on Roku but was on Fire TV I gave it a try. I've been very happy with it and have switched all my Roku's out with Fire TV's.,pos
If you are an Amazon prime member then amazon fire with Alexa is a no-brainer. No need to subscribe to cable tv when amazon fire has all the movies and apps you need. Try it and you will be hooked.,pos
"Got rid of DirecTV and purchased an Amazon Fire TV. We stream video every night and the picture quality is incredible. Just make sure that your internet speed is able to keep up if you want to watch in HD. Nice to be able to cut the cord, save some money and not sacrifice picture and sound quality",pos
This amazon fire tv box is amazing. The picture quality is awesome,pos
Awesome product it's better than cable t.v my family and all love it,pos
Love the new fire TV. replaced my Cable TV box. now I just need to have internet services!! save me a ton of money. I can watch live TV to on demand movies. great product!!,pos
Great easy to use product for streaming. Very pleased with it.,pos
"If you are thinking about cutting the cord to cable TV or getting rid of satellite TV, this is the way to go. As long as you have an Intenet connection, this device can give you anything you can think of to watch. Great product!",pos
No problems. Easy to setup and use. Streaming videos is pretty darn good with very little lag over my wireless router. I use a Netgear Nighthawk x6. Recomend getting the firestick tv. Great bang for the buck.,pos
Great streaming device comes with alexa which is top of the line only regret is not getting the one with game controller alot of games require game controller or need it to make the game fun now im forced to buy it separately,pos
"Bought the FireStick after daughter got one and loved it. Went to get a second and they were out of stock. Was told the FireTV had faster processor and could handle 4K...don't have 4K, and honestly it's not worth the extra money for the processor speed difference ...save money and buy the cheaper FireStick",pos
Great product would highly recomend this. Sales person was really help full,pos
Easy setup and use. Couldn't ask for a better product.,pos
This is a great product to buy o be able too watch all kinds of shows An movies An more worth every penny,pos
The fire tv box is the best and fastest steaming player out in the market. Have 4 devices in my house and got rid of my direct tv subscription. It's the best.,pos
"Best thing ever! Since I bought the fire stick, I hardly watch regular TV. We are thinking about cutting off our cable to save money because the fire stick gives us every show/movie we need from regular cable.",pos
Purchased the Fire TV over the Fire Stick because it os capable of streaming 4K. Device works great.,pos
I previously had a Roku however decided to purchase the Fire TV Box instead. It definitely meets all my needs and has been a real pleasure to use.,pos
The fire stick is the holy grail of entertainment. Easy to set up and easy to use. The apps are user friendly and easy to navigate.,pos
I absolutely loved it it is the best thing that I have used since cable,pos
"Easy to use, and worth the money. Lots of movies and other features",pos
I have two of these and four Fire Sticks. They are great for accessing Amazon content and any of your other favorite streaming apps/games. With a moderate Internet speed there is virtually no delay for programming to start. Alexa remote is handy so you can quickly search.,pos
I can say that amazon fire tv is a great product for people who enjoy watching their favorite shows in a easy way with out too much work...don't think about it too much just buy it :),pos
Nice product I would recommend this to everyone who has it for friends,pos
"Best purchase of 2017. If you don't own one of these devices, you need to!",pos
"No need to purchase a smart tv with this device. Wish it came with an hdmi but I pulled one off the unused x box system. I also purchased some velcro from a craft store to mount it to the back of the tv. It is very light, so no need to buy any kind in mounting kit for it.",pos
"Much better interface than Roku, love the 4K features",pos
This helps me stream a lot of channels but not have to get expensive cable,pos
Very happy with it. Set up was fast and easy. Worth the price,pos
"Debated between firetv and Apple TV and ultimately went with firetv due to price. Works great, easy set up and easy navigation. I have not had any buffering issues.",pos
"I bought the Amazon Fire TV about a month ago. I reviewed the Roku, Apple TV and Chromecast. This one was rated the highest and i haven't been disappointed. I also have the Apple TV. It was more and difficult to operate for my wife.",pos
This is a great media box! Streaming is smooth and the remote is simple and easy to use.,pos
I love how easy it is to use and the variety you get.,pos
Every thing I've read about the fire stick is pos,pos
Amazon Fire TV Brings pretty much every streaming app all under one easy-to-use interface.,pos
"Amazon is obviously banking on this item and the Amazon Sticks. In all fairness it is a great product with a lot to offer and a good price point. I like the Voice control feature to easily navigate through your favorite shows, movies and all. I also have a smart home and like the flexibility to control every inch of it from my TV remote too (control lights, doors, Electronics, you name it). You can also do a little programming and installed Kodi to have free movies and such, Yes I said FREE, anyways it is a great product.",pos
This product is easy to use and you definitely get what you paid for. It is also easy to insall.,pos
I love this thing its freakin awesome to own and fun,pos
"This is an amazing product, I can't get enough of it! I use it everyday for hours, never have to pay for movie tickets with this box, plus it is also great for other apps, games, netflix, tv shows, it's up to you!",pos
The FireTV box is a great device to help with cutting cable. It has 4K streaming and all the apps you need to watch movies and tv on the device or you can download them. You can install side load and install android apps on this as well. I would recommend one to anyone.,pos
Just like the title...fast and perfect together with amazon prime (you don't need to have amazon prime to use this player),pos
I have a roku tuner and am not impressed with iy. I find the amazon tuner much easier to find programs.,pos
This was a really good product. I really enjoy streaming movies and TV shows.,pos
The picture quality is great.It's easy to hook up.,pos
"Very easy to set up. Bought it so I could get Directv Now. Wired and wireless connections were used. Now I can watch tv, Netflix, Youtube, all with the same device.",pos
fire tv offers so many more channels to watch. Give you more than you ever had,pos
Best thing to replace Att U450. No more pricey cable bills,pos
"I upgraded from the fire stick to the fire TV and man what a difference it made. Way faster a lot smoother and overall just a better experience than the fire stick. Don't get me wrong the stick is affordable and does the job,but if you want faster and smoother transitions from app to app the fire TV is the way to go.",pos
"Even though I'm an apple lover, I've turned to the firestick and fire tv for internet access on 4 tv's in my house. Very happy with the ease of set up and the performance.",pos
"Nice interface, easy to use, voice search is fantastic!",pos
"best thing to buy, if your tired of having to pay high cable prices. Very easy to install. will be buying one for my parents as well.",pos
THIS FIRE BOX IS A GOOD STREAMING DEVICE. Would recommend this product.,pos
"Excellent product, amazing resolution, great quality",pos
Just plug it in and off you go....easiest electronic setup there is.... di turn out I didn't need it as the Samsung TV I bought has the Amazon Prime app on it.,pos
"Amazon Fire is a great product. We did have trouble with the remote after a long while, but Amazon was able to help and the App works great",pos
"Purchased this as a gift for my husband and didn't know what exactly it was all about. Once we installed it and saw all of the things we can watch on it, I was hooked. Very easy to navigate through all of the apps. Considering dropping our cable provider because most of the shows we watch are available through Fire TV. Highly recommend! We will also be purchasing a couple of Firesticks so we can watch in other rooms.",pos
If you can jail break it. It will be a nice product,pos
Purchased product to stream and it appears to be working well.,pos
I upgraded from a first gen Firestick. The Fire TV box is lightning fast. Tons of apps to play with. It could either be an addition to your cable/satellite tv experience or it could help you cut the cord.,pos
I purchased this and was on the fence but after using it I have purchased more.,pos
This is a wonderful streaming box. It was easy to set up. There has been no lag and it provides channels I cannot get on my Apple TV. I absolutely love it.,pos
"Great product. An excellent alternative to the much more expensive Apple Tv. Gives you the option to display 4k context (Netflix) wich current version of Apple Tv does not allows you to do. I bought so that I can have the SlingBox app wich you can not get with Apple Tv, Sony Android TV, LG OS, or Sony Playstation 4.Great product. Highly Recommended.",pos
"We have Amazon Prime, so I wanted to replace my older Apple TV, so I could stream directly to the TV. Very happy with purchase. Alexa works well, which is an upgrade over just the Fire Stick.",pos
"First I wasn't sure to buy a Roku 3 or the Amazon Fire TV. But I am glad, I bought the Amazon fire. It works perfect and with Alexa, she makes my life easier.",pos
This is a great device. Easy to install easy to use.,pos
It is a device that basically is easy to setup and the remote is great.,pos
"Like it very well so far, easy setup and streaming works great.",pos
I got a second one for my downstairs TV. Works great,pos
It's super easy to use and it looks good next to the tv with its sleekness. We have had no problems with it as of yet.,pos
"Without costing a ton like the Apple TV, the Amazon Fire TV has everything a cord cutter could want.",pos
Love the Fire TV!!! Can tell the difference in load time and changing menus. Would recommend this to criends and family.,pos
I bought two of these this year and I love my Fire TV it's very fast and fairly cheap the customer service was great when I bought my Fire TV. I can watch my Amazon Prime Hulu Netflix everything from one box. I will be purchasing one more cuz I love them so much specially when you stream using an ethernet cable which the best. This box is really fast it does not buffer,pos
Excellent streaming box fills all of my needs. Would highly recommend.,pos
Amazon is a great product. Use with Prime and get shopping benefits!,pos
I love this device! Its very easy to use and makes cable irrelevant.,pos
Love the product. It is amazing for streaming and has wide range of applications. Great Product overall.,pos
SO FAR SO GOOD I AM HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT I PURCHASED,pos
It's simple to use and I've had no issues. Do need decent internet speed to stream live tv.,pos
"Very fast, no buffering and better than fire stick when you use hardwired Ethernet.",pos
Shipped fast. Easy setup. Works great. Would definitely recommend.,pos
I love my Fire TV Box!! I use it almost everyday!!,pos
"Everything we watch is on here. From Amazon, Netflix and everything in between we have access to all our favorite apps and content.",pos
Easy to set up and lets me stream everything I want to,pos
This is a fantastic product. Picture quality is awesome. Increased our internet speed so hardly an buffering. Much faster than the stick.,pos
Loved the item - worked great. Packaging was good. I was very pleased,pos
Our family streams movies and tv from amazon and direct tv now and this is great,pos
Good for kids and adults sometimes it takes a little time to pull up old movies but shows great.,pos
I RECOMMEND THIS ITEM WoRTH ThE $$$$$$$ saving me tons on my cable bill,pos
"This is a great piece of technology, it has 4K video output and all apps for Apple TV are available also for this box.",pos
Exactly what I thought the amazon fire stick would be.,pos
The Fire Stick is easy to setup and use you will love it,pos
Great device. Works great and so far no issues. :),pos
setting up was easy. no issues watching it or set up,pos
I love it it was a good investment but hard to set up.,pos
Easy to use and has many options. Like how it can be utilized on two different units.,pos
"I already have Apple TV, but bought the Fire TV, since it's so highly rated, for another room. So glad I did, because it's worked out GREAT for less money than the Apple TV.",pos
I like this item you can watch a number of shows and movies streaming 4k,pos
Ni problem at all. Run good easy to use. The remote very usefull,pos
I was a bit skeptical at first about purchasing this device over a Roku. I am so glad that I did. Even though I have cable tv I end up watching this device for movies and other entertainment more then cable tv. Everything loads super fast.,pos
I have two amazon fire sticks. They were nice but kind of slow. Got this amazon fire tv box heard it ran faster which it does but the remote dies faster... A little over 30 days of course after the return period the remote sizzled. Good thing for the remote app.,neg
"I get amazing streaming quality and speed, love the voice activated controller",pos
Love this product has so many movies old to new as well as tv shows tv episodes. Its super.,pos
"Having enjoyed Amazon Prime for several years, I thought to bring it to the next level when Alexa support came to the Amazon Fire TV. Complete access to all my Prime benefits, newest shows/movies, music and more! Screen mirroring works good too. Unfortunately I do not have much time to lounge around and use it more. Overall a good buy!",pos
"Love it, great for intertainment and I would recommend",pos
Fast shipping and very happy with the amazon fire tv.,pos
works great. just like the reviews said. thinking about another one,pos
This was one of the best purchases that I have ever made.,pos
"Works smoothly, no problems. Amazin has a great selection of tv shows and movies.",pos
Great product...no problems at all. If your looking for a great media streaming look no further than the Amazon Fire TV.,pos
Thought it couldn't get any better than my Fire Stick.. Turns out it can be faster!,pos
This device has made me wonder why I didn't cut the cord years ago.,pos
"The Amazon fire Tv is an all around great product for a great price. It is a little more expensive compared to the Fire stick but it is well worth the price difference. The Fire Tv offers 4k compability and also seems to be a little faster. It allows me to watch all my paid subscription it one place such as Netflix, Hulu and even amazon prime without have to use my PS4. All in all I would recommend this product to anyone who has paid subscription it works well with them and let you view them all in one place.",pos
Set up is easy and works well from the start. Will purchase another for the extra room,pos
Bought this as well as the Roku ultra.. Both are great products no issues whatsover.. If ur a bit more advanced Fire TV is more modifiable as its based on Android while Roku isnt. but still Fire TV is very simple for the basic use of even my 4 year old kid... Alexa is a great plus only one downside is it doesn't navigate within Apps to control the apps themselves it only controls Fire TVs main features... While in Roku the direct netflix button on the remote makes it slightly simpler to access netflix.. In short both are amazing products so if ur comparing u wont go wrong either way.. I would highly recommend Fire TV and am very pleased with my purchase,pos
"I was having some ""stutter"" issues streaming services through my Samsung Smart TV and thought I'd try an Apple TV or Amazon Fire as an alternative. Liked the Fire's ability to stream in hire definition (already have an Apple TV on another set) and lower price. I've been using it for months. Solved my ""stutter"" problem, works great, and talking to Alexa makes it easy to search and use. Just wish the Apple TV had an Amazon app and the Fire had an Apple app.",pos
It's great in performance compared to fire stick amazing product,pos
i am so pleased with my fire tv ! Very easy to operate!,pos
"I do not use anything other than Exodus, so I see no difference between this and the firestick.",pos
"Works fast, no lagging. Clear picture, much better then the fire stick",pos
Great just really great. It's like Trump is talking about my amazon fire box,pos
I like the fact you can talk to the device. More convenient than the others.,pos
Item works excellent replaced my apple tv with this unit.,pos
Yes I like it my husband really like the way it work l like that it don't take up to much room,pos
"Already own 2 Roku's. Purchased 2 Fire TV's and found the performance and usability very good. Replaced Cable TV withe them parred with PlayStation Vue Core Slim. The menu system/DVR is as good if not better than Cable. Mix that with a Tivo interface and Netflix, it is a game changer.",pos
"Works great . Able to listen to radio ,watch tv shows ,",pos
The Amazon fire tv has a better resolution 4K and it already has most Apps installed on it and you can install your own too. I haven't regretted purchasing this amazing amazon amateur!!!!,pos
"I have to start by saying the last thing I wanted or needed was another device in my system. Being an Apple household I would prefer that my AppleTV handle the functions that I purchased the FireTV for, namely Amazon Prime Video. But apparently the feud between Apple and Amazon won't end in favor of their customers, and Amazon won't be building a Prime Video App for ATV.So I picked up a Fire TV and have to say I'm impressed, especially for the price. Many Apps (including Prime Video and Music), Netflix, voice control, even 4K (though I haven't tried that). No AirPlay of course, so I can't get rid of my ATV, and it doesn't integrate with my Macs the way ATV does. Bottom line, I got it for Prime and it does a great job, for a non Apple house it would be all you need.",pos
The media player is compact and low profile. The remote is nice. The unit/remote freeze up quite often requiring the player to be unplugged to reset it. This may be due to the fact I am running Kodi. I do have a first generation firestick with Kodi that does not freeze up like this unit. The performance differences between the firestck and this unit are negligible in my opinion.,pos
The wife and kids love it. Thinking of buying another one.,pos
This is so much faster than my old blueray player loading apps and streaming. Works great and so many options!!,pos
"I had been looking for something to watch my Amazon Prime and this gives me an easy way to do it plus Netflix, HBO and more. Easy plug and go makes it good to move from room to room easily",pos
Exactly what I was looking for! Has most of the apps available that I wanted :) Very easy to use and set up.,pos
"If you know what you like you can easily use this instead of cable and save yourself a whole bunch of money. Has lots of great features, like Netflix and Hulu, and its very easy to use. The direct connect to your router makes for a flawless connection! We also have the firestick but this is better for a busy room like the living room. Definitely a great investment!",pos
Love my foxfire box. Easy to setup and works well!,pos
Love my fire tv..... Mad I waited so long to get it but the best thing that has happened to me so far this year!! lol,pos
Great as expected great customer service. I've gotten this before and it's great,pos
"Had a roku and wanted to compare how the FIRE TV performed. Ya can't lose with either one. If you see one of these FIRE TV on the shelf, grab it as they don't stay on the shelf long.",pos
I have a fire stick for the tv in the living room and I bought the fire box for my bedroom tv. The speed for searches are much faster. My only issue now that just started is with the internet connection it keeps dropping out. I have it hard wire. Not sure what's going on. I think the network port is on the way out.,pos
This was the perfect product for my family as it provides tons of streaming resources!,pos
Very easy installation. Picture quality is great and no lag at all.,pos
This was a big help in cutting the cable cord - its great saving money,pos
Great little device. Time to cut the cable. Easy to set up and program.,pos
This item is great for me and my family. We recently have started looking for innovative ways to watch television and found this product beneficial!,pos
I started with the fire stick and then upgraded to the fire Tv it has a much faster processor and runs add ons better. great for your home TV set,pos
"Awesome streaming device, love the alexa feature!!",pos
Very easy to set up and use works great on my non smart tv,pos
Great product very easy to use. Installed kodi on it and love it.,pos
I had the firestick but decided to get the box based on reviews and am happy i did because the box is much faster and better overall.,pos
This devise is much faster and easy to use. Highly recommended,pos
We are enjoying it so far. We really like the fact that you can play games one it. I would definitely recommend.,pos
This piece of technology is amazing. It works great for me since I have it hooked up directly to an Ethernet cable. It also works great with the wifi. I've since cancelled my cable & use all the amazing apps to watch live tv.,pos
this product was amazingly fast n has made my smart tv even better,pos
"fast and responsive, love the interface, lots of content to watch",pos
"Works amazing and offers a lot of apps, games and music.",pos
"This is the best steaming device, to run many additional applications that will run smoothly.",pos
"Good product, easy to use. Fast processor, speedy internet card",pos
"If we were going off of percentages this would get a 90%. This improves greatly over the old Fire Stick. With a faster processor, 4K support, and the freedom to install 3rd party apps, this is literally the only device you need to access just about anything you could ever need. The only gripe I have is that it is missing Vudu, otherwise, it's one of the best streamers currently available.",pos
"I've owned an Apple TV, Chromecast, and now this. This is my favorite of the 3 because of the highest quality of streaming. The one downside is that it is not compatible with my echo dot.",pos
The fire tv is one of the best android boxes out there great for any streaming media you can imagine,pos
I've been using this box as a replacement for cutting the cord w cable. I have no regrets. I stream everything from live tv to catching up w tv series and/or movies. Easy to use interface. I hated the remote though and got a remote w a keyboard on it. Works awesome!,pos
The Amazon Fire Stick is compatible with a Samsung television,pos
This is terrific. What a joy. Easy to install. Easy to use.,pos
Love the amazon fire tv. So easy to use! Couldn't be happier with my purchase.,pos
the best streaming player ever and super fast for you tube and netflix,pos
I love my fire TV and I love best buys service.They deliver just like they say.,pos
I went to buy the fire stick at Best buy as it was recommened to me and was out of stock due to a recient add and the popularity of the product. I Read some reviews and decided to buy the fire tv great product easy to set up and use alexia is nice and has more storage space.i would recommend this product.,pos
Much better than expected. Easy to use and set up.,pos
"Easy to use, great for many apps. I like the fire tv version because it can accept an Ethernet cable.",pos
This is must have because streaming is the future of TV,pos
I really like fire tv box it is user friendly and and I would recommend it to anyone I know.,pos
Easy set up but did not meet my needs of being able to access Spectrum app. .,neg
I have both the FIRESTICK and AMAZON TV. I choose to to get the AMAZON TV for better streaming and live channels. Thus far I am satisfied.,pos
Amazing resolution is a great diference with the firestick,pos
I would have like Alexa to help me f8nd stuff in YouTube and other apps instead of typing it out though other than that it was an awesome investment,pos
Works great with sling tv to fill the gap in shows I watch,pos
"I bought and returned this item. I was hoping to be able to watch different sports games via the internet with the Amazon Fire TV but everything I selected stated it wasn't available. After trying different things for a few days, I figured I wasn't going to get the results I wanted and returned the unit.",neg
This is the best device to stream to your tv with all the apps available. It costs more than the firetv stick but I recommend it because of the quicker processor and expandable memory.,pos
"This is our fourth Amazon Fire TV. Integrates great with Alexa, and so easy to set up with your Amazon account.",pos
I've used Roku and Chromecast and I assure you that the Fire TV beats them both by a country mile.,pos
It was what i needed all this time and i really recommend it for anyone,pos
Easy to use and great picture. Alexa voice control is good.,pos
Absolutely love this product. Best decision we've made for entertainment.,pos
"Much faster then the tradional fire stick, I highly recommend it over the fire stick!",pos
We were looking for a streaming option in 4K and this one works great. Great picture and sound!,pos
You can watch almost anything on this thing and the quality is amazing!,pos
Quick and easy to install and simple to use my 6yr old knows how to work it,pos
I got rid of cable for this and trust and believe it is worth it.,pos
It is a good product - enjoying more options for movies,pos
The firestorm I purchased is absoutley amazing I love it,pos
Read online and price compared to get a great deal,pos
I love the Fire TV and have had no issues. It is very easy to use and setup.,pos
Works great and I haven't had any issues. Easy to use.,pos
It's good to have this box if you like to watch tv series and programs other than spanish channels.,pos
I bought this online and picked it up in store. It wa Lana very easy process. The setup is extremely easy. I use Kodi on it and it works great. I used Kodi on a Firestick and there is no comparison.,pos
Absolutely love the amazon fire tv. I got this because it was one of the few streaming services that was compatible with DIRECTV Now. And it has not disappointed! Runs super fast! It only buffered every once and awhile. But Bot enough to cause an issue.,pos
This fire Tv is a great product and it met my expectations.,pos
I visited a friend who had one and I was sold immediately. I love how all your streaming needs are in one little box. Plus it works with Alexa. I intend to get Alexa real soon..,pos
Straight out of the box It was so easy plug and play. Voice prompt worked great,pos
Sometime it just stays in sleep mode and you have to restart it,pos
"Cliche Alert: I never do product reviews. Let me tell you, I'm a Apple fanboy, and I'am angry that I purchased the new Apple TV before the Amazon Fire TV.",pos
Very fast and interface is cery user friendly a+ rating,pos
Have both the stick and now the Fire Tv. Wish i would have bought this from the get go. Worth the extra money.,pos
I love this it was the best thing I brought My kids even love it and it easy for or them to use,pos
I love my Amazon Fire TV box. It is so quick and I have access to so many Apps and programs. I recommend it to everyone.,pos
"Bought 2 for main TVs in the house. Fast processor and no buffering encountered with HD picture quality. Great for various streaming services, lots of free movies and shows if Amazon Prime member, and loading Kodi opens up much more options for free!",pos
The fire TV is much faster and more polished. I highly recommend it.,pos
"Used with Playstation Vue, this box rocks. It's fast. Plus, when fast forwarding to skip commercials, you actually get to see what corresponds to the timeline, unlike the Roku Streaming Stick, which only shows the current image plus how many minutes ahead or back you can go (not the image, just the increment). With the Fire TV, you actually see the exact minute and second on the timeline along with the image at that time. Plus, Fire TV lets you fast forward up to 64x actual speed.",pos
"The fire TV is definitely better than the stick. The stick used to freeze on us, but the TV doesn't seem to have any problems or delays. It works exactly as it is supposed to and helps me find programs for our son when I can't find them in other places!",pos
Fire Box works great. Much better than Firestick because it can be hard wired directly to modem and also had more memory than stick.,pos
"enjoy this product, very easy to use and update when needed",pos
This device works great and is capable of so much!,pos
"I had a firestick and moved it to my wifes TV. Decided to get this for the replacement. It is much more fluid, and integrates with my Alexa via the voice remote. You will like it.",pos
I am enjoying control over what I watch and not watching same thing over and over like with cable.,pos
"i bought 2 as gifts, but i had a chance to use one of them, and it is great, probably as good if not better than apple tv, and I currently have an apple tv in my house. The music app alone is worth the price. And the set up was very easy. I am seriously thinking about getting one for my bedroom. It does not come with he HDMI cable, and that would be an extra $15, maybe cheaper depending where and the length you get, but it is still cheaper than an apple TV.",pos
Great device. Amazon is the way to go! Great quality of shows!,pos
I have been using multiple fire sticks for the past two years. The Fire TV blows them away in speed and quality. I would recommend it if you subscribe to amazon prime,pos
"This device is great for bringing in content to your tv. This device has a wired Ethernet port, USB and a micro SD card slot.",pos
We purchased this after we decided to get rid of cable. Very easy to navigate much better than using a game system.,pos
this product works most of the time. there are frequent issues with reception,pos
This device has a lot of good features. Once you pay for Amazon prime your able too watch a multitude of movies.,pos
Perfect product that met my needs and expectations.,pos
"I was resistant to buying an Amazon Fire because I thought my smart TV and cable box were doing a great job. However now that I've tried it, I'm planning to add one to the other 4 tv's in the house. It's seamless and so fast, and the ability to just talk to the remote instead of typing is AWESOME! We constantly use it now for streaming Amazon, Netflix, HBO, YouTube, and more. Seriously thinking about cutting cable TV out of our budget altogether.",pos
"User FriendlyI was able to tie up all my streaming into 1 display. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Directv Now, Alexa is great, just hold the button down and ask away!!!!",pos
"I tried the Amazon Fire TV after trying the Fire Stick, sue to the better ratings on resolution and the ability to hardware my internet connection to it. With these two features, the high definition in no different than what I had with Directv, which solidified this was the right decision. I now have 3 of them in each room of my home.",pos
Really love this device. Has all the bells and whistles. 4K view is awesome,pos
"if you need a media player and access to Amazon Prime Video, this is the perfect device. Interface is smooth and efficient. I have one for each TV in my house.",pos
Firebox is the best streaming device of all of them. Excellent product. Best App capabilities. Easy to use.,pos
Had troubles at first as I was using a dual modem/router. Once I bought a separate modem and router it worked great and the picture is even better than what I was getting with Xfinity!,pos
"I have had it with high cable bills and was looking for an inexpensive alternative. Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it’s not cable. I miss cable, but I don’t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer.",pos
"In an effort to cut the cord we purchased the Amazon Fire TV. It has all the apps we needed: Vue, Hulu, Netflix, Prime (obviously) as well as HBO, Showtime and the network TV station apps. It's easy to navigate and with a little setup we're cable free! Would totally recommend.",pos
I am absolutely loving the amazon fire streaming devices,pos
"get more movies,shows channels great price easy to install and usenet more for your money",pos
"Amazon Fire tv is the best box, fast, good interface and simple",pos
Bought it to see if there was any difference between it and the fire stick there wasn't. Will probably place it in the guest bedroom since I really don't have a need for it,pos
VERY HAPPY WITH STREAMING CHOICE. THE FIRESTICK TV,pos
Love the streaming capabilities on this item. Really saves a lot with the increasing cost of cable.,pos
"Intuitive to use for the built-in Amazon, Netflix, etc., etc., and allows for streaming directly from the computer, too.",pos
"And this is amazing. Blows Apple TV out of the water with all the customizations..especially Kody. I have every apple product that currently exists, including all their computers, however, I will be replacing all my 4th gen Apple TVs with the Fire Tv.",pos
"Works on wireless networks, awesome for streaming 1080p AND 4K content.",pos
Like the fire but disappointed that they were selling a device that is a model that is two years old.,pos
"can""t go wrong with this item it"" a great investment the price is right great streaming.",pos
Easy to use and great resolution for viewing high definition content,pos
"setup and ran this box within 10 minutes, very portable, and works just great",pos
I love this unit. The picture quality is awesome the system ui is easy to use and there are a ton of streaming services offered,pos
Great box for Playstation Vue and Kodi. Works great and easy to set up.,pos
I bought this hoping to make good use of my 4K TV but realized that there is very little 4K content out there. But at least I'll be ready then.,neg
"The main deciding factor as to why I got this device as opposed to the stick was that I gave me the option to either use WiFi or to use an ethernet cord. So far I can say I've been happy, the apps are vast enough to find what i want in regards to entertainment and the navigation isn't to complicated.",pos
Very easy to use. There are lot's of different options.,pos
I have a Roku as well and this is just as fast and has a comparable picture quality.,pos
laods up quic k i love the voice remote...awesome product,pos
Good value for the money...easy to set up and use. Would recommend to anyone,pos
WORKS WELL FOR ME DON'T NEED CABLE TV CAN STREAM ALL MY PROGRAMS WITH FIRE TV,pos
"Great product no complaints, spend a little extra on good internet and never worry about cable.",pos
This ia a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for entertainment.,pos
"Not many negative things to say. It's solid, and comes with a lot of preloaded content. Sign in with your Amazon account email and you're set. Use a USB dongle and wireless keyboard to really streamline your input, in case the voice command leaves you frustrated.",pos
Enough memory not any lag on loading programs.......,pos
This has been very best Android box I ever purchased. There is so much to watch and very easy to use.,pos
This is by far the best stream box I own. Besides being a premium Amazon memeber makes this even better.,pos
Bought the Fire Tv over the Fire stick due to the fact that it has more memory. Great for streaming. Only problem is that it freezes sometimes and you have to hard reset it.,pos
i havent had a problem since i been using it. it works great,pos
"Love it, screw cable. I save a lot of money every month",pos
You don't need cable service anymore that means you can save money with this :),pos
i love this amazon fire tv box and best buy had the lowest price and they have the best customer service,pos
"Does what's advertised! Great with 4K handling. Seems to handle streaming very well. Customize-able. Recommended if you're thinking of ""cutting the cord"".",pos
I go to hotels frequently and do not like satellite tv or their limited channel selection. This small device connects easily to the wifi and all flat-screen TVs I have found. Life saver on a 2 week training event.,pos
"These boxes are great, reliable and you can download what ever you want or need for your viewing pleasure.",pos
"Great product, small and barely noticeable on top of my DVD player.",pos
"Set up without a hitch. Downloaded MLB app and that works perfectly, and is the main reason I got this. Netflix also very usable on this device.",pos
I am so happy with this purchase. I no longer have a cable or satellite bill to pay every month. Saves me $160 a month. Easy to use once you learn,pos
"Great product, easy set up, easy to hide but pleasant to look at. Works great but have not found any content that was Dolby digital. Picture is nice",pos
I love my firestick. We choose not to do cable to save money in our first apartment and it has been great with the firestick.,pos
One of the best streaming devices for the price. Bonus points if you are a Prime member or invested in Amazon's infrastructure.,pos
This is the best alternative to cable. Very easy to use!,pos
The box is ok havint Sean any 4K content on it yet,pos
Best FireTV yet. Shows 4k and 1080p content well. Amazon Prime members get extra benefits.,pos
"I would def buy this product, works like a charm. Don't buy anything other than a fire tv",pos
"I am able to see my Directv, Netflix, and amazon prime all in one system.",pos
Fire Tv is easy to use and navigate. We use it almost everyday.,pos
I love this box. Better than the firestick by far.,pos
I absolutely love my amazon fire it is very user friendly. I bought one for my parents and used theirs so much I decided to buy one for myself as well.,pos
"Excellent product, it was very easy to install. Compatible to all of our electronic equipment. Very user-friendly – love that it it has the voice feature on the remote.",pos
"This is a well made box, perfect. It uses android so there is almost nothing you can't do with it",pos
I had 2 Fire Sticks and bought this FireTV to begin streaming PlayStation Vue. It's much faster than the other streaming devices I have and the whole family enjoys using it.,pos
I absolutely love this Amazon Fire TV!! It's processor is so much faster than fire stick which I love the stick too. I get to watch so many of my favorite movies and tv shows plus they have so many great apps for anything you want!! I highly recommend this product!,pos
This unit works great. We ditched cable and this is a great alternative. We have had no problems with this unit.,pos
Hassel free easy set up and use. Great price with superior performance.,pos
This has to be the best of all Amazon products for the television... you can store more memory and the rom speed makes no lag time on any show ... after this i will never buy a fire stick again...,pos
Easy to install. Easy set up. Would recommend to friends.,pos
I like the fire tv because I can hook my lan cable to it,pos
It is much faster than the firestick and much higher quality picture.,pos
Great product for those that have service from different apps and devices. Here one can access many in one device with ease of setup.,pos
LOVE IT!! Easy to use and can get rid of my cable bill,pos
"Amazing!Already have the fire stick, but this runs faster, very good!!",pos
This product is amazing! It was an easy set up. Plug and play. And good to go!,pos
This is so much better than roku. It's a must buy.,pos
I had purchased the Fire stick before the box. It runs a lot smoother and lags far less than the stick.,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is very reliable and worth the price if you are a serious streamer I recommend it highly!,pos
I love the Amazon fire TVEasy to set up and easy to use,pos
This product is excellent with apps available for many strraming services and capable of third party app implementations as well.,pos
I am glad I purchased the amazon fire tv. I get all the channels I want and more. Love the high def. I have been recommending it to all my friends and neighbors.,pos
Smooth UI... much quicker & less laggy than the Fire TV Stick. Streams 4k as well so can't go wrong.,pos
"4K works great, instant connection. Content on fire TV (and stick) are always improving.",pos
Essentially it works well for its intended purpose,pos
"1st Amazon Fire, I love it! Best investment for my tv.",pos
Works great. I got this because using the smart tv features on my smart tv didn't stream video very reliably. This does.,pos
"I use this not just for amazon prime, but I love the convenience of adding other apps like Netflix and sling. No need for a dish outside the house to enjoy tv",pos
The fire TV is a nice upgrade if you have the fire stick. Its fast and has expandable storage. Best for TVs with high resolution.,pos
Works great. Having a physical internet connection works great for streaming,pos
Saved on cable bill and bought this on sale at best buy. Great device! Its better than roku and the google chrome.,pos
This product works the same as the firestick but is suppose to have 4K and better quality. To be honest it looks the same on our 70 inch 4K tv. This product does not come with the cords to hook it up. So you need to buy an hdmi cord and an Ethernet cord which adds to the cost. But I do love the Amazon product compared to other devices.,pos
"Have both the Apple TV and now the fire. Picture quality is noticeably better with fire, as advertised. The only issue is the organization of the home screen could use some work, but overall, worth the money",pos
One of the best investments ever. Work great with all the streaming apps.,pos
Love this way more than the old fire stick...so glad I upgraded...It was easy to install and I'm once again enjoying my shows,pos
Good product works as advertised use this to stream videos from my smart phone,pos
Easy to use and install. Faster than running directly thru TV or DVD player.,pos
"With the Amazon player, you don't need satellite TV. Saves you lots of money from cable or satellite companies.",pos
"Compared to the firestick, the fire tv blows it away.",pos
Very easy to use! Love that you could talk to it and take you where you want.,pos
This item has allowed me to eliminate my cable. I love having any movie I want at my fingertips.,pos
"Runs awesome for a good amount of time. Unfortunately sometimes the device disconnects or asks to be refreshed, during that time the remote does not work and it is frozen on that screen. Other than that it runs very fast and is a great unit. The fix for that is unplugging and replugging.",pos
FireTv is great. Easily installed and user friendly.,pos
Does what is needed. Can watch both Amazon and Netflix on TV,pos
Will be getting rid of cable as as soon as possible!!!,pos
Works great time to cut off the dish this is all I need to watch you get everything.,pos
Works great.Great buy.Wouldn't have anything else.,pos
The firestick tv is awesome and easy to use its also small,pos
Has all the major streaming channels and is lightning fast. Highly recommended.,pos
Excellent Product.The Fire TV is the all around entertainment unit that continuously keep improving. I have it Paired with the Echo. Truly enjoyable.,pos
"I'm a prime member and I bought 3 amazon Tv, if I have more rooms I would buy more",pos
"I bought the amazon stick as a bday gift for my cousin. It's pretty easy to use, with its plug and play features",pos
I definitely recommend the fire tv vs the fire stick,pos
works............................................................,pos
I bought a firestick for every television in my house. I can watch whatever I want and it also decreases my cable bill.,pos
Lots of useful apps and options that give access to anything you could possibly want to watch.,pos
"The best media player, very easy to work with. Love the 4k display",pos
Great product. Enhances my TV options!! I enjoy the ability to have access to many programs when I want them.,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is very easy to setup works faster than Fire Stick because of a Ethernet connection.,pos
This is the best streaming device to watch movies on or even Netflix.,pos
We're finding it hard to navigate this thing. Others (mostly the young ones) think it's easy.,pos
Works great and KODI is totally worth the price becaus you save a lot on not having to use Netflix anymore,pos
"Upon using a few other android devices, I settled on this. The software is perfect, snappy, and overall awesome. Very easy to set up, just sign into your Amazon account. Much much faster than the fire stick itself. That is how you can justify the cost. If you are looking for an android style device look no further than this!",pos
Very satisfy with this device. It does everything that I want it to do.,pos
Fast functional easy interface small great control Kodi mobdro Amazon what more can I say,pos
Excellent quality. Easy to set up. Works great. Definitely recommend.,pos
Love my Fire TV Box. Works great and highly recommend if you are in the market for an android box!!,pos
"I like how easy is to watch movies, tv shows, and also play video games in this fire tv device i like it and really recommend this to anybody!",pos
Works great with so many options. Haven't been able to get the 4k to work but that might be the hdmi cable currently connected. Everythings wotks extremely fast.,pos
It's awesome being able to have 4K capability and being able to play games but it does get laggy at times.,pos
"Love the Fire TV. It is fast and reliable. I have all my movies, tv shows and apps in one place.",pos
Firestick provides opportunity for families to spend more quality time together with many features and endless supply of movies,pos
I got this to replace my Apple TV and I am not disappointed.,pos
I replaced my smart dvd player and this product works amazing and fast,pos
"Are used to have an old laptop hooked up to my TV to view all of my streaming apps. This makes everything much easier. No problems, easy to set up, easy to use.",pos
"I have never been a fan of ""smart"" tvs, the interfaces of the best are terrible...The firetv interface is clean, fast and does what i want with relatively little fuss. These are a little more money than the firetv sticks, but much faster and have USB ports for wireless keyboards",pos
"Bought this for my other tv which has an Amazon fire tv stick, world of difference as the fire tv is so much faster, buffering no problem",pos
The Amazon Fire Stick is an amazing device that makes it easy to watch movies and navigate through apps - I love the fact that I don't even have to use my smart TV apps because the fire stick has it all. I would definitely recommend.,pos
If you're looking to stop being ripped off by cable and satellite companies the combo of the antenna and fire tv are perfect!,pos
I have this and I also have a Roku in my den. They both have their pros and cons. I do not use the remote which came with it. I use my harmony remotes to control the devices. I also have an echo. I like the front end on the Fire TV better than the Roku. The biggest con for me is the Fire TV doesn't have the VUDU app.,pos
I love how fast it goes from one program to another program I like the apps that it has on it and also I like that is able to work with all my televisions that will problem.,pos
The fire tv works well with ethernet. Not so much with wifi,pos
I were told about the fire stick tv from a friend so went to a best buy store to buy one.the store had to order me one I had it in my hand in two days and I have been enjoying it. Use it everyday.,pos
"Excellent product for movies, tv and games. Only hiccup is the remote, wish had more buttons.",pos
This is the best way to go if your sick of cable bills. Movies galore on this.,pos
Absolutely love it friends and family all purchase on,pos
Fire tv excellent for streaming tv channels. Cut the cord for cable.,pos
Works very well and easy to set up. Use this to stream DTN.,pos
This is what i believe is the best purchase that i made. Android platform and loving it. Able to cut the cable and is dependent on Fire TV. Highly recommended.,pos
Amazon Fire TV is easy to use and is very easy to setup.,pos
"I really like this product because I can get tv programs, music & movies that are not available with my cable box. It was easy to set up and easy to use. There are apps that you can download that makes this really fun to have. I was using the firestick and was having buffering issues, but with this speed has not been as issue.",pos
I am really glad i decided to purchase the firebox. Faster than the stick.,pos
happy I purchased it. Have had no problems and was easy to set up,pos
"This product is really good.. this product does everything it says.... you can watch hull,Netflix,penthouse,hustlers, Showtime,HBO,you tube the streaming is unlimited.",pos
The remote works great manually or in voice mode. It takes a little time to learn to navigate the applications. But it was a good purchase.,pos
Love it more then a fire stick. Not as much lag and runs so much faster,pos
I had just about every android box out there and this is my favorite. I hate the fire stick but love this.if you want something that works great get this.,pos
"I found the Fire TV to be a good box for streaming, but not great. Two things that stood out is the low internal drive space and so so speed.I would recommend it, with a clear understanding of the short falls.",pos
"Nice. Processor power was never a problem with the original Fire TV, so for streaming purposes, the new chip mainly serves to support 4K Ultra HD playback. Provided you have a 4K TV with an HDCP 2.2-enabled HDMI port, along with a fast Internet connection (Amazon recommends 15Mbps), you can stream Ultra HD content from either Amazon Video or Netflix. The Fire TV even labels Ultra HD content from Amazon video on the home screen, so you can quickly jump in.",pos
Very happy with the performance of the fire tv. I also have first gen fire stick and the load time and lack of buffering on the fire tv is great. I'm also a prime member and the quantity of programming is pretty god. Would definitely recommend.,pos
"We have both apple and the fire TV, we like the fire tv the best. It's easy for all ages to access. Glad we bought it.",pos
I purchased this mainly for streaming tv since we canceled our cable. Works great and has a excellent selection of apps.,pos
This is so much faster than the fire stick...highly recommended.,pos
Great machine to add additional apps and games to any smart or non-smart TV. A must have for streamers.,pos
Love it! Replaced my google chrome stick with the fire stick,pos
Love my fire tv so easy to use gives me all my services in one place,pos
What else can I say? I can finally watch 4K content on my TV. The firetv is ever bit as good as the firestick.,pos
good quality product will buy again best buy always has what i need,pos
Bought a firestick and the box the same day. The box has larger memory so I don't have to worry about clearing my cache as often.,pos
"Purchased this and the fire stick, this definitely showed a better picture quality and response compared to the stick. 4K imagine isn't bad at all and would consider this a good deal.",pos
This product was just as expected. Will order more.,pos
So far it has done exactly what I want it to do. It is much faster than the fire stick,pos
Grateful I have the hottest item of the year and it works great! Thank you Best Buy!,pos
Great for streaming media and other online things. No lag since you can connect it with a cord instead of over Wi-Fi if you are having lag issues.,pos
"This is my first streaming TV device and I am new to the technology. It was very easy to set up and configure, taking only a few minutes. It worked like a charm! I then downloaded Kodi onto the device, following a youtube instructional video. While Kodi takes a little more patience and time, once installed, it is an awesome supplement to the Fire TV. Between the built-in service offerings and the vast amount of free streaming services offered via Kodi, this device is a 100% winner!!! No more cable and satellite TV subscriptions for this person!!",pos
I was surprised with the quality of this product and although is pos it doesn't have as many apps as Roku is still excellent.,pos
If your tv is not a smart tv and you don't have a gaming system this is the appliance for you! Easy installation and very portable so you don't even see it!,pos
I got this box's for a gift and they love it and for that price can't beat that,pos
Ready to buy another pleased with item overall easy to use,pos
This provides better sound than the built in Samsung TV sound but not as good as a full surround sound system. I liked the fact it had a digital audio connection to the TV and it comes with the cable.,pos
I purchased my Fire TV to replace a Fire Stick and I am VERY HAPPY with my decision. So far I have not experienced any lag and it is so nice to be able to plug an ethernet cable into my Fire TV .,pos
Little bit of learning curve but love it now. Probably will buy fire stick for other tv.,pos
"I may have set my expectations a little too high. This replaced a dedicated htpc, but I will probably swap it back and attach it to the garage tv.",pos
I definitely recommend getting this amazon tv over just the fire stick. It does a much better job of running all apps over the stick.,pos
EXCELLENT PRODUCT IT SAVES YOU MONEY ON WATCHING YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOWS AND SPORTS AND MOVIES .,pos
I have this and I bought this for the gift of my brother-in-law and I am really glad to see the smile in his face. It works great and it is good for a movie fan.,pos
"Picture is top-notch...4K capable. Also, something I discovered on my own that the ""experts"" in the stores did not know or tell me: even though you don't have a 4K capable TV, the Fire Box may still be what you want instead of the Fire Stick...here's why: when you watch live news or sports they are broadcast at 30 frames per second. The Fire Stick only can produce 20 frames per second, so the picture looks somehow ""previously recorded""...jusy not like a sharp, high-def pucture. So I replaced the Fire Stick on my 1080p capable TV with the Fire Box and, BINGO!, perfect...because it can reproduce 30 frames per second! You'll see the difference, trust me!!!",pos
The Amazon Fire Tv is simply awesome. It has over 50 apps for watching tv shows and movies. There is nothing that this thing does not have when it comes to streaming apps.,pos
Love the fire tv. Easy to set up and easy to use. Great quality content and streaming,pos
I absolutely love this fire tv. I can't seem to put down the remote to stream different things.,pos
It down strings very well works very well with our direct Now TV would recommend this product,pos
The amazon fire tv is great in all aspects and is so fast,pos
Defiantly worth upgrading from the fire stick does not freeze nor does it get hot and need a cool down time.,pos
Great features and easy to use. A must buy for Prime members.,pos
This streamer box is very easy to set up. It finds the WiFi quickly. A nice and enjoyable addition to cord cutting.,pos
"It's so hard to decide If i should recommend this device or not. It's super fast, gorgeous images processing when paired up with my Sony 4k. However, it doesn't have turn off button. You have to make it ""sleep"" to turn it off, or else they will keep turning on and keep draining your wifi resource. Too simplistic controller make it hard to type. No option to sign in and out of an app. You have to wipe the app clean or reinstall the app to sign into another account. These can be easily fixed with better software.",neg
"Great streaming device with a lot of options to watch, highly recommended and super easy to install and use",pos
Tried setting this up on 2 TV's using both WIFI and Ethernet for hours. Could never get a signal. A total waste of time.,neg
"Bought this at Best Buy only because Amazon was out of stock. Does 4k video, tons of apps that support it. Just make sure that your cable company is on the list of providers for standalone apps, e.g. HBO Go, Discovery, History, Travel Channel etc, else you'll find yourself not able to watch their specific content on this box. Bought it mainly because I use Playstation Vue to stream content and hate the tile setup on Roku. PS Vue on the Fire TV is a timeline setup, I prefer this much more than the Roku setup. Great box, works flawlessly with Alexa and Prime memberships. IMO, worth the $90, plus I got a free 30 day trial of Sling. Although I think the Sling trial is a con more than a pro hahaha!",pos
I always purchase the fire sticks til someone told me to try the fire boxWish I would have done it first. Love it. Much betterSpeed faster,pos
The Amazon - Fire TV is easy to learn and wonderful customer service they will walk you throw any thing you need help with.,pos
The picture quality is great. It's easy to use and great for my home.,pos
"Purchased Amazon Fire TV due to previous reviews stating that it performs fast with PlayStation Vue. Tried it out for a month and all it did was constantly buffer. Checked my internet speed and router/modem and I have the fastest 1GB speed available. Reviews on PlayStation Vue state that Roku interface is not as good, so I purchased Amazon Fire Stick to determine if it has better performance. Love the Amazon Fire Stick. Extremely fast and no buffering with online streaming with PlayStation Vue on the Amazon Fire Stick. Save your money and get the stick.",pos
Very good product. Works well with all televisions.,pos
Works great when connected directly to wifi router.,pos
The box is better than the stick must have for anyone that likes to stream,pos
Go ahead and spend the extra for the FireTV. Worth every penny spent.,pos
"The FireTV is definitely faster than the Firestick and the performance is most noticeable when navigating across both native and third party menus. Relative to the Roku, the amazon user interface is lacking and a bit cumbersome to navigate. But all that doesn't really matter if you're getting it for the same reason I did--Kodi.",pos
An excellent product. You can stream everything on it.,pos
Good product would recommend to buy it to family and friends.,pos
No joke I have one on every tv in my house.This unit is so powerful and *customizable.The content of movies and tv shows that you can stream is almost unlimited these days.,pos
overall good but voice control does not work yet. support is not easily obtained to resolve the issue - it still does not work,pos
"I'm a Prime member, so this was a no-brainer. Wish you could get the ""pirates"" version like the stock though.",pos
with the Alexa voice it saves a lot of time and worry,pos
love it... the amazon fire tv is perfect for our trailer while traveling....,pos
Great for movies or any shows you want to binge watch. So many more options than just Netflix,pos
"This tv box works great!!! Easy to play, and good quality",pos
"Amazon Fire TV works very well with the Sony Play Vue. I purchased a second unit for another TV. The response time is quick and the Alexa voice search so quick and good its beyond good. I do not use the WiFi function although I have a Wifi in the house, instead I have a Ethernet cable plugged in for both units. I would most certainly buy this unit again. Worth every penny I spent on it.",pos
Hook-up and set up is simple. You are able to watch TV quickly after set up! I was pleasantly surprised by the app options. I no longer miss having satellite!,pos
"Boy was I surprised. I never intended to cut the cord but after I purchased my Amazon Fire TV and DirectNow TV o thought I'd give it a shot. Now I'm saving $80 per month, have all of the channels I watched on cable, and I'm saving $80 per month and very pleased!",pos
Amazing.. jail break and you get free everything... TV movies whatever!,pos
Love that my whole family can use this for anything from sling to Amazon prime to gaming,pos
Very fast and tons of apps to download with plenty of space to store them.,pos
"The whole reason for getting a Fire stick was to download Kodi TV and additional addons to get streaming movies and TV. I also have a Fire TV for the largest TV in the house, which is faster. Now that it is up and running, I am going to cancel my cable TV and just keep the internet service.",pos
This is a far better product than the fire stick that I first started out with it is a lot faster at everything it does and it hardly ever buffers. I would recommend to spend the extra money and get the fire tv.,pos
Favorite streaming device hands down totally worth it.,pos
"It works exactly for what I need it to, I like that I can have all of my streaming programs on one device.",pos
Works great easy to operate well worth we use it instead off cable tv,pos
Works better than roku plus apps like psvue were developed with more love. Roku also had some strange problem with working on a tv that requires hdmi to dvi,pos
This Amazon TV was very easy to set up. I really enjoy all the features that it has to offer. I find myself not watching cable TV as much because now I can pick and choose the type of programs I prefer to watch. The problem with cable TV other than the outrages high prices is that you are paying for channels that you never watch.,pos
"Before buying the FireTV, I had the FireTV Sticks. In an effort to cancel my cable, I signed up for Sling TV.",pos
there were so many movies to pick from and also so many tv shows to watch all in great quality.,pos
Works flawlessly most of the time. Would be 5 stars if amazon would stop fighting against people rooting their devices. It's our streaming box. Let us do what we want with it.,pos
"Don't know why I waited so long to ""CUT THE CORD"" and with AmazonProducts like these it's definitely a ""NO BRAINER"".",pos
Easy to use even my 6year old can do it! We use it on a daily basis to watch Netflix and play games on it!,pos
Excellent product that does what it is built to do and that shows great movies. Purchase this product Roku and this is a much better product. Love that I can watch other streaming apps as well on this device.,pos
"Amazon Fire TV is quick and easy to use, believe it has enhanced both the video and audio. It is a perfect combination with Amazon Prime. Received professional advice from Best Buy Associate, thanks!",pos
"I love the Amazon Fire TV box, Amazon makes great products that are great for anyone.",pos
"Working great and I love it...it's has a great quality ,good graphic and easy to use..",pos
There doesn't seem to be much for 4K programs. Hopefully more to come.,pos
Nice product but does not always respond to voice commands which have to be repeated.,pos
Works great in my entertainment setup. My only real complaint is that you can't control it directly using an Echo - currently using a Harmony Hub.,pos
It work great the first time and just bought my 2nd for a different location. The cord is that much closer to being cut.,pos
"We purchased a couple Amazon Firesticks first to facilitate cutting the cord. The Firesticks are ok for bedrooms or less used TVs, they just don't perform as well as the more powerful Amazon TV Box. I will be purchasing another one for the movie room. It's been great cutting the cord. But the one thing I'm waiting in is for Hulu Live to make it over to the Amazon platform. They keep saying soon, so patiently waiting. Hulu Live looks to be much better than our current Sling service. Other than that the box is great and that one issue might be Hulu or networks holding it up.",pos
Got this item to watch movies.... has Netflix and most other places to watch movies and tv shows,pos
it is a great product. I would recommend this to a friend,pos
"Good for streaming off internet , no buffering on Lodi and live tv !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",pos
Simply great and easy to set up!!! I would recommend this to anybody.,pos
Fantastic product at An affordable price and fast delivery,pos
"The Fire TV is easy to hookup and easy to use. Lots of apps. Alexa is fun and useful for programming questions, weather and controlling some of my smart home lights. The request would be to control TV volume on the remote.",pos
"It has a great picture. But, This is not different from the original fire stick.",neg
"we love this Fire Tv, just hard to find shows for now.",pos
"I didn't take the time to read the reviews on this as I actually went to the store to buy a Fire stick. The salesman talked me into the Fire tv instead supposedly because of higher picture quality. I haven't noticed any differences. For an average user, maybe the stick is just fine and you save money.",neg
The Firestick is awesome! Would highly recommend to anyone for their tv.,pos
"New smart tv, sound bar, and AlexaThe Fire brings it all together. Good product !!!",pos
This product works awesome for getting current movies and tv shows. We live in a rural area so we have some buffering issues which is sometimes frustrating but overall this is a great product and has provided access to many more viewing options,pos
We decided to cut the cable and love the options the Fire Tv gives us.,pos
Easy set up. Very easy to use. Was easy to install.,pos
Easy to set up and simple price is good cant complaint,pos
"The fire TV box is 10x's better than the firestick. It's faster , has more storage, and is less glitchy.",pos
"We use this on a daily basis, a nice upgrade from the fire stick!",pos
The Amazon Fire Tv has worked great for us! Super easy set up!,pos
Would completely recommend this product offers everything we were looking for in a movie box system,neg
Grate product! I would definitely recommend! Say good bye to cable!!!,pos
it a lot different from the Roku . but it get the fob done,pos
Great product! Definitely buy this brand first!!!!!,pos
This box is better then the fire stick I can finally look at 4K movies with this box then I could look on the fire stick and it handles my internet very well which is 5.0ghz wifi no problem,pos
The Fire TV works just like it is supposed to. I got it mostly to watch CBS all access and it worked so well I purchased a second one 1 week later for another TV.,pos
"Better capacity, faster processor overall worth the extra money.",pos
Do not turn cable off. Using with cable service...,pos
I love all the apps. All your favorite shows and movies at your fingertips,pos
Unleash all the tv shows and experiences you wanted to with this Amazon Fire TV box. Even better if you have a Prime account. I could watch all my entertainment right. No more high cable bills.,pos
"Fire TV is an awesome tool easy to use and designed to be quick, light, and filled with options.",pos
This Amazon box works better than the fire stick. 100% happy with it.,pos
It is nice not to have to pay for tv and have so many more choices.,pos
if you want to have multiple apps this is what to get,pos
"Runs kodi extremely well, the on board apps and services are great too. Really a top of the line media box. Can't utilize 4k yet but some day!!",pos
"its ok, u have to buy all the subscriptions and sometimes half of them just buffer the whole time, I have very fast internet and its wired so idk whats up with it.",neg
I love this. So many apps and the quality is compatible with a 4k TV. The only thing is sometimes the apps freeze and restart sometimes. This doesn't happen often though.,pos
This was a major update from a smart DVD player. Much faster and easier to use.,pos
I LIKE THE FIRE TV STREAMING MEDIA PLAYER. IT WORKS WELL.,pos
"faster then the firestick tv version but not as portable, still a great product for streaming",pos
this box does all it was said to do and more. It is a lot faster than the firetv stick I use when traveling. the 4K content looks great.,pos
"This is the way to go, has everything you need and more.",pos
Great choice for amazon prime members that want optimum flexibility and resolution,pos
Spend the extra money and get this instead of the firestick. Way more responsive. The time saved scrolling the guide on PS VUE alon is worth it.,pos
The firestick is great and sasy to use.I tell all my friends how great it is . I have purchase one gor my travels,pos
I love it. These things are sold out everywhere. Except at BestBuy.,pos
"I got this to go along with the Vizio P65-C1 I bought. The Vizio is a great display, but with no internal tuner. It must be connected to cable or a streaming/casting source for programing, The Fire TV makes it easy to connect to Netflix and Hulu, among many other program sources. But, it's especially great if you're a Prime member, giving you access to Prime Video, both free and purchased. The only think I'd change is if it could receive HDR programs/movies. Amazon Video does have HDR programming available for a growing amount of its content, but this version of Fire TV does not. If you don't have a UHD TV, Fire TV is about perfect.",pos
I already own a firestick. I decided to buy this one for my 4k tv due to it supporting 4k. I moved my firestick to the bedroom tv. Great product!,pos
Absolutely love it! Watch movies all the time. Great investment!,pos
"Amazon Fire stick is perfect for anything. We play the games, stream movies and I like listening to Pandora Music. Its all in one.",pos
Price is great for the purchase and the quality of the picture is great,pos
I upgraded from the fire stick to this. The fire tv runs much faster than my fire stick. Great product.,pos
if you are a college student or just want to go and cut off your primary cable to save money go for it. It will have a little getting use to and everything isn't as clear as you would want it to be but it is definitely due able for watching tv shows and movies....,pos
"Amazing fire TV is simple, works seamlessly. I like the streaming speed, and cache on the device. Amazon has lot choices interms of movie. Big bang for your buck.",pos
So much more powerful and with an actual LAN connection the speeds are much better too. If you can afford it get the box over the stick.,pos
This thing is much better than the fire stick version it's much more powerful and faster and the best part is you can connect it to the internet via ETHERNET CABLE.,pos
Fast to install and I very easy to work it's got great resolution,pos
I can watch anything I want on fire Tv. Best thing ever,pos
"We did a lot of research when looking for a streaming device to use on an outside television as we didn't want to add another cable box. Amazon Fire TV was the best option. It is so convenient and easy to use. The voice commands are excellent. It also has several apps that are unavailable on Apple TV that we truly enjoy, such as TCM. It also has USB port available. We highly recommend Amazon Fire TV for anyone searching for a streaming device!",pos
"Me and my wife used the fire stick to stream shows for over a year and recently upgraded our internet to a higher speed package. To take advantage of the new speeds I thought I'd get the fire TV to use the Ethernet port on the back. Not only does it stream the shows much faster and HD works much better now, but just clicking through the menus is so much nicer with no hesitation. If you are on the fence go with the fire tv and save yourself the upgrade later. Definitely worth it.",pos
Need an alternative or supplement to Cable TV? This is it. There are many entertainment options with the FireTV. I can not sing its praises enough.,pos
We love the amazon fire tv the 4K definition is great easy to use,pos
"Since moving to the Fire TV, haven't missed DirecTV!! This a great product loaded with features that is very easy to use.",pos
Works pretty good but it's slow or glitchy. Either way it's good for the price.,neg
The Video quality on this is lacking compared to other streaming devices. In the plus side you can use kodi. I would get a roku if you don't plan on using kodI or a nividi shield if you plan on using kodi.,neg
Outstanding! We Love everything about it and look forward to what comes next!,pos
I have bought 3 of the amazon fire tv boxes. I love how many online services you can access via the fire. I would rate this a perfect 5 if it was not for the fact that the fire remote is so poorly made. 2 of the 3 remotes died before the batteries did. Sure you can use your phone to control the fire tv box but that is slow and should not have to be done. And dont try to get help from Amazon their idea of help is to have you buy a new fire tv box.,neg
"I was hesitant to upgrade from my original firestick to this, but I'm glad I did. It works much faster and smoother. Well worth the money.",pos
I have really enjoyed binge watching shows on Netflix and exploring all the options I have with the fire stick.,pos
If you're looking to install kodi this is an excellent buy. Fast processor easy to use and a good price.,pos
We now have fire TV in every room of the house. Very user friendly.,pos
"Great tool for streaming, HD is awesome and sound is to, only wish it had ability to stream from USB stick or external HDD.",pos
Love this product! We have been able to get everything we need and cancel cable. Saving us lots of money!,pos
It is really easy to setup & to connect to. Really easy to select programs,pos
Bought for my daughter on Christmas. She has hooked it up and and has enjoyed using it That's good enough for me. :),pos
"It works as advertised, great for college students",pos
Alexa thats all you need the voice command is amazing. Looking for shows or browsing,pos
Previously had two Roku devices and ended up switching both to Fire TV's. Interface feels much better and apps seam to respond better on this than the Roku.,pos
"I have no use for cable since purchasing this device. When used with subscriptions to amazon prime, sling, Hulu and Netflix, you forget you don't have cable. The stronger your wifi, the better your experience:",pos
"I was hesitant at first to buy it. But now I use it daily. Definitely recommended if you have an Amazon prime account. You can watch movies and listen to music on here. I bought the fire tv instead of the stick for future use of 4k content. It also has a micro sd slot, usb port, and digital audio port. With the support of apps you can stream content from your home networked PCs also.",pos
"My daughter had the fire stick at her home when I went to visit her , I liked it So when I got back home I went and bought the fire tv box due to it having more memory, it works great",pos
The only concern is there is no filter on free apps. Also the parental control password is a bit cumbersome and enforcing on too many option rather than just not allowing new financial purchases.,pos
I love the Amazon fire tv. I have so much access to television series and movies.,pos
"I bought one from BestBuy instead of buying one that is jail-broke. That is a moral choice for me. That being said, I can add the apps I want. The hardest part so far is getting used to not having a DVR and not being able to fast fwd through commercials...but I'm saving over $100/ month over cable, including the $40/month of apps that I'm currently buying.",pos
"This device is great to stream a variety of content. It does not buffer like the stick since it plugs into the Ethernet on the router. I would recommend for your ""streaming"" needs.",pos
This thing is used everday. I had this guy Vincent program it with cody.he has been doing this for several years. Cable channels movies just like my direct Tv.,pos
Perfect. Stream tv easy to use remote. Easy to set up,pos
Between this and an hd antennae I cut cable and I am never going back!!,pos
Every app that I needed with no problems. No other app runs as well for the price.,pos
This works wonderful. We cancelled Direct tv and went with is instead. Love it.,pos
"I have had the Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) - Black for about 1 1/2 yrs, I love it. I have found the fire tv to be much better in regards to less buffering than the fire stick. Great product.",pos
"In terms of mid-tier streaming devices, (Apple TV, Roku, etc.), I think the Amazon Fire TV is by far the best. The interface is neat and well designed, and the product has the most recent technology to allow for fast streaming over lower-tier streaming devices like the Chromecast or Fire Stick. In addition, I think the Amazon streaming devices offer better features for Prime members than what other devices can offer.",pos
I like the Fire TV much better than the Fire Stick.,pos
"This amazon fire box works great. I don't have cable, we use the apps and Netflix that is connected to wifi. Easy to set up. We have one in every room.",pos
I would suggest this over the fire stick and over the android tv.,pos
"New to streaming tv, but Amazon offers many good channels and features. Easy to set up and use.",pos
My fire stick is one of the best electric devices I have ever bought.,pos
This is a great product if you have kids the apps and kids stuff is great,pos
Hard wired as opposed to wireless. Easy to install. Much better than fire stick,pos
I love this. I can load all my apps and watch pretty much everything I ever used to watch on cable. The only thing is I wish I could get the Hallmark channel...but other than that I'm very happy for the price.,pos
This box is probably one of the best things that I've ever purchased!,pos
Great streaming device and it provides a nice picture and access to streaming services.,pos
4k on Fire if you want a 4k streaming with Amazon.,pos
Overall I think it was a great product. I would definitely recommend to a friend.,pos
"Lots of pre installed apps, fast os, and rf remote",pos
Better than the firestick because it has more memory and also has Ethernet port so you can plug directly into box for faster results.,pos
I really enjoy this product. I referred it to my daughter.,pos
Amazon does everything well. This is a terrific product installs easily and you don't need to be a tech guru to use it.,pos
Love the fire tv. Does away with loading times on the fire stick.,pos
"I was glad to get this device to help me ""cut the cord"" and get away from the cable TV high rates.",pos
"More than satisfied with my Amazon - Fire TV. I previously had a ""stick"" and gave it to my friend. This product is FAR SUPERIOR. I love that you can use a wireless mouse/keboard via USB port, and have the option using WiFi or an Ethernet cable for network connection. SO MUCH FASTER when hardwired. I RECOMMEND EVERYONE CHOOSE THIS... Definitely worth the couple xtra $$",pos
"Helped me ""Cut the Cord"" on television subscripton bills",pos
Love the firestick. You don't need cable tv anymore.,pos
Easy setup. I will buy the second one for my bed room,neg
We watch channels we use to watch on cable and very satisfied with the access.,pos
I will never pay for TV programming ever again. I love my fire stick,pos
"Nice way to stream movies, .......................",pos
I've owned firesticks in the past but the speed on the fire tv box is definitely much faster! Very happy.,pos
"Probably a fine item for most but i bought it for a specific application, the best buy employee said it would work but unfortunately it didn't.",neg
Love the setup of this fine streaming tool!!! Use it daily,pos
If you install kodi you get access to tons of movie although some are low res,pos
"Unless I'm not using it right, I can't voice search within apps outside of the amazon realm. Other than that, pretty sweet setup.",pos
Faster then the fire stick plus SD card for storageWorth the extra price,pos
"So far fire tv has been just what I expected, works well, gives me what I wanted,",pos
It's a pretty good product. Took a little getting use to navigate,pos
Excellent way faster stream you pay for what you get,pos
"Very happy with device ,,, may purchase second device",pos
Great little box that does cut the cable streaming. Almost all of those services are on the box and seem to work fine on it.,pos
Bought to listen to Pandora and MLB.tv. Awesome!,pos
"It's fast, content is great and as long as no HDR isn't an issue, it's a great alternative to the Shield at half the price.",pos
I love my FireStick but the addition of 4K streaming is worth getting the FireTV. It seems to be noticeably faster as well.,pos
"This box will replace cable, food and water. If it didn’t need power, I’d live for free!",pos
This product is great and user friendly. It's easily accessible and has plenty of apps and Channels to watch!,pos
Awesome device! Using it to cut the cord and it works great,pos
"Fire TV provides a full range of choices from multiple sources, including Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Showtime Anytime, among others..",pos
"Fast processor, excellent interface. You need this if you are cutting the cord.",pos
"I have tried numerous Media Streaming Devices, and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. This particular steamer offers a solid combination of hardware, apps, settings and tweeks, as well as expansion options and upgrades all for a reasonable price. You can obviously stream media from the Internet but you can also play games, stream live TV, watch 4K content, add USB and/or SD storage for expansion and off-line access, connect a USB and/or Bluetooth keyboard/mouse/joystick for enhanced interaction, connect Bluetooth headphones or speaker(s) for added listening options, and more! Unless you're looking for a specific advanced feature or functionality, the Amazon Fire TV provides a solid overall Media Streaming experience!",pos
"This is a great streaming box, and I enjoy the voice search option. However, I wish that the Amazon Fire tv when doing a search on the main screen would provide you the options of a movie or tv. show from apps that you have a subscription with and not just Amazon. Of course I can go into each and every app that I have a paid subscription with, but It would be nice to do a search from the main screen and display results across the board.",pos
"I love the amazon fire TV and other amazon products I have purchased. The gentleman who helped me at the store, was very gracious and patient in spending time explaining to me.",pos
I initially purchased Nvidia Shield TV but returned it in favor of Fire TV. The driving factor was the apps and it has everything you need.,pos
Fire TV provides good quality picture and great remote control.,pos
I bought this because I have Amazon Prime. This was really easy to set up. Picture quality is excellent. Better than cable or satellite.,pos
"I bought it for online streaming and its awesome, very convenient and easy to set up. Works awesome with WAN and LAN.",pos
Learning how to stream movies from Netflix and my amazon prime my wife and I are really enjoying my fire tv.,pos
"I really love my Fire Stick, it has been a great entertainment device",pos
We love our Amazon Fire TV! We get all our favorite shows and movies. It works perfectly!,pos
"This remote is especially good for those who eyesight is weaker, due to aging. I got it as a gift for someone, and it makes searching for channels easier for the elderly.",pos
I can go in this place and spend hours. Best prices and quality products.,pos
"The Fire TV was very simple to setup and gives plenty of different viewing options. I currently subscribe to Netflix and Playstation Vue, both of which I can access on the Fire TV. I've also downloaded apps for ABC, HBO, Showtime, NBA TV, and others to expand my capability. Certainly worth the price even if you don't subscribe to Amazon TV.",pos
"Great picture, hooked up via Ethernet it works flawlessly. With fire Tv there is no need for a ""smart tv"" or a cable bill.",pos
good product for the price very good if your an amazon prime memberkodi works somewhat ok with it,pos
"This product is a lifesaver, the quality is excellent and is not difficult at all to setup and use. The abundance of apps you can install is great and it has become a staple in my family!",pos
I bought the Fire for a second tv as I already have one and like it. I bought the Fire because I am a Prime member.,pos
No need for a smart TV. Just pick you up one of these and you are set. I purchased a 4K TV which had limited apps but was 600 less than the one which supported the additional app I wanted (PLEX) so I opted for the TV I got with this FireTV and I was set.,pos
We canceled cable TV 3 years ago because of the rising cost. With Amazon TV we can subscribe to Sling and get our favorite cable shows for 15% of the cost.,pos
There are tons of apps and everyone can watch what they want. with the micro SD card you never run out of space. in my opinion is better than the Apple tv. I have both.,pos
"I found the Amazon Fire TV responds faster than the Amazon Fire Stick. Plus it has an ethernet port! On my setup, this helps out a lot since I have 8 Fire TVs running Plex. If all of those were on one WiFI AP it would probably kill the bandwidth. The Amazon Fire TV loads quickly and works as expected. The only thing I don't like is I wish I could customize the home screen so it would only show what I want it to.",pos
"As a retiree, I need to reduce expenses. DirecTv is way too expensive so I plan on watching more movies and TV shows through my Amazon Fire TV.",pos
"This product requires significantly less buffering than the fire stick.For sure would recommend over the Fire Stick if you are planning on using this for streaming, especially for movies or live TV.This product also incorporates Alexa so you can control your smart home from the comfort of your couch.",pos
The fire stick is easy to use and set up. I wish it were easier to search for movies and shows.,pos
"Great for online content such as movies, TV shows, Music and games from the Amazon online store as well as streaming stored content from networked pcs or NAS boxes. You can also side load applications such as KODI for online content if you consider getting rid of cable television.I gave it 3 stars because even though it will allow for high definition video and theater surround sound, competing products can do those better.",pos
"Amazon Fire TV is a great streaming box, easy to set up and use.",pos
Great for streaming media slingbox Amazon prime Netflix Kodi great value,pos
"If you don't care about live tv this will do great for you. Otherwise, can't ditch the cord yet.",neg
Just make sure you have good internet speed and you will be all set.,pos
I like it because you can hardwire it. works a whole lot faster then the stick.,pos
Works great for watching tv shows. Plugged right in. Easy to use.,pos
It work perfect. I like the design and love the remote control also.,pos
I have Roku and Apple TV. I use this one mist because it allows my to add additional functionality- like Kodi Performance in as good as others and the voice commands - Alexa - are great,pos
I have two fire tv boxes and they work great. I pluged my direct into the router with a patch cable for very fast speed. The wifi is also very strong and works great. Love the optional storage slot for a flash card.,pos
Works exactly as expected. I bought this in an effort to convert my old flatscreen with no smart capabilities into a smart tv. Definitely got the job done!,pos
The Amazon Fire TV Box is much better than the fire stick. I really enjoy the streaming speed and how fast I can navigate the menu screen. I am happy I upgraded from the Fire Stick.,pos
My fire TV did not disappoint !! I am able to do everything I wanted to do and then so much more !!,pos
"I love this Amazon fire thing so much, I said bye bye to direct tv.. This will also save me over $100 a month. That's just icing on the cake for me!!!!!!!",pos
Very good product especially if you are into high end hq tv products fast easy to operate,pos
This product is easy to set up and navigate. Great for catching up on missed tv shows.,pos
I purchased the item because I was cancelling Direct TV. I ended up going back to Direct TV but still use this device to easily access my Netflix and other channel apps.,pos
"Easy to use, the only problem appears to be with the remote control. Seems like it stops working at least once a week.",pos
Does the job it’s suppsed to. Get it and enjoy life in the fast lane,pos
The Amazon- Fire Tv is a great tool for streaming. I suggest it to anyone that didn't ha and a Smart TV but wants those options.,pos
Great for the price. I bought it to have access to pureflix. I'm loving it so far. Would recommend.,pos
This is the third time I have purchased this item for the tv's in my house. I completely love it,pos
Best performance I can get. Just plug n play few mods and you are on.,pos
I had the older version. This new version is definitely faster and it support 64 bits apps,pos
Great alternative to cable. I have purchased these for several of my family members. I have a 70 inch 4K tv and the picture is clear. The device is user friendly and can get many apps.,pos
Very loud. Great sound. Sub Slides under couch so it doesn't get stepped on,pos
I purchased this item thinking it would show a higher quality in picture than the firestick but it does not in my opinion. Only difference it has more storage.,neg
Nice for watch nexflix play games best item i buy .,pos
"This nifty little device is perfect for freeing yourself from the clutches of the evil and nefarious clutches of the dreaded cable empire. No longer will you be subjected to their random price raises of their already high prices. No more will you fret over paying exorbitant fees for channels that you don't even watch!! Yes this firestick can and will open up, quite literally an entire new world of viewing for you. Set up is simple and quick. There are a multitude of different apps that u can use to take complete control over what u want to watch and pay for. I'm not going to go into specifics about how to watch everything you want because we all have different interests. A simple google search will help guide you with those specifics. But just know that for financial freedom from contracts and corporate giants this is the way to go. One downside I will mention is the buffering. Ensure you have a good internet connection. This is a requirement for the device to work. Make sure u keep the device free of any unecessary apps which will take up its HD. Also ensure you have a router that is worth while. Personally I ended up going with the firebox instead of the stick because I wanted the best connection possible and as we all know that requires hard wiring of your device. So if u want to replace cable for your main living room tv area go with the box. For kids or something get them the stick.",pos
get this and you won't go wrong. I love the speed of it and how easy it is to set up. My child loves the ability to play games esp if you get the game controller with it as well.,pos
This device is very easy to use and it's also fast and so many movies to choose from! I would highly recommend this to anyone!,pos
Just my . opinion but i like the Apple tv better. Just easier to use,neg
It's great I love it would recommend to anyone worth the money,pos
"This is my first time using a media streaming device and it seems to be very easy to use. You do have to purchase some premium content, but there is a lot of free content also.",pos
Faster than my firestick in navagating around and doesn't freeze as much.,pos
This box is as good or better than my Apple TV (latest version) with more options.,pos
We love it no need for cable! Just make sure you have really good internet!,pos
I use this device for streaming live tv with no issues.,pos
"The Fire Stick runs nicely on the bedroom TV, and I have the Fire Box setup on the main TV.",pos
Love for old programs or programs I have missed and navigation through some very interesting programs that are not on regular tv on pay per view,pos
I did away with cable and was trying to choose between a roku and firebox. Decided on the firebox and so happy I did. Works with all my other amazon products.,pos
The product was very easy to use straight from the box.,pos
Works very well as long as you have good internet speed. Saves us a lot of money not paying for satellite.,pos
"I have a 1st generation and 2 of the second generation FireTV devices. I've been very happy with them. What I didn't expect was my Samsung remote to work with the Amazon unit since the Amazon remote is not an IR remote, but the Samsung remote works great. Very happy with the responsiveness of the FireTV unit. Menus seem very intuitive.",pos
Product is awesome. I love it it's easy to use and is fast.,pos
Its good to have along with cable. Hopefully you get one as a present and not purchase yourself,pos
"Works great, easy to use, picture is great too. Not missing my cable bill at all.",pos
"I bought this after I bought my Firestick, and this is faster. Works great with Netflix, easy to install and load, picture quality is fantastic.",pos
"Really impressed with this little device. It has all the. Ells and whistles including 4K UHD streaming in Netflix, Youtube, and Amazon Video. However, it does not stream in HDR ( not a deal breaker for me). Love this device.",pos
I would highly recommend this product too anyone ! 5 STARS !!!!!,pos
"Easy to instal, easy setup, simple clean navigation, love this product",pos
Very happy with this product and not having to pay outrages cable/satellite bills. Set up is a breeze.,pos
The Amazon Fire TV is a must have for anyone the loves to stream movies and videos.,pos
I tried the Roku but the Fire TV was just more flexible and the menu was easier to navigate.,pos
Amazon fire have the best window from all the others out there even apple tv,pos
"This Fire TV is a better choice than the Fire Stick from a connectivity standpoint if you have a LAN connection or if you have potential wireless connections. It also has the advantage of expandable storage, although I've not found a need for it yet. As with the newest Apple TV, the Fire TV uses a graphic intensive interface. Although the Fire TV doesn't have the Apple's volume control, selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by Apple. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the way Amazon chooses to organize the selections. All in all, the Fire TV is the best way to take advantage of your Amazon Prime Membership.",pos
We enjoy looking at movies and other shows on our New toy.,pos
"I'm very pleased with my fire tv purchase. It was highly recommended and it indefinitely delivers. So many tv shows and movies are available, now to find the time to watch them all.",pos
"Where to begin? Let's see...easy wifi or Ethernet setup. Runs all my apps. Runs 4K. Super small footprint. The remote is nice, plus voice activation(if you're into that). Super easy navigation once you setup all your apps.",pos
It has helped me not need the cable company and their many unnecessary channels,pos
I have to say I have enjoyed this over many droid boxes and I think it's easier to use. It has gotten locked up a few times and I had to unplug it to have it do a hard restart. Other then that I have to say for the price it's a good product,pos
I brought this product and love it it is much faster than the fire stick and works great wit) my home automation,pos
It was nice to have an extensive library at my fingertips.,pos
Like all amazon stuff i have used these things are great built insanly well and eith a reasonable price tag way better then any of the rokus i have tried.,pos
Works well. The kids love it can watch everything on it.,pos
"Well, since I have to use up at least sixty characters in this review, I can say it woks.",pos
i no longer us tv this is my new go to for my tv show needs,pos
I have had the Firestick and recently upgraded to the Fire TV. Wow what an improvement over the Firestick. Well worth the slight up charge for the improved performance.,pos
"Cord cutter here. We had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our comfort zone. Since we are Prime members, we finally decided to give Amazon Fire TV a shot. We've been using Fire TV for two weeks now and we'll never go back to cable!PROS:Ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which takes up very little space.Simple remote (and a free app so you can turn your cell or tablet into a remote).No buffering issues have yet come up (although that may be because I have a very strong internet connection).Seamless interaction with our Prime Video account and Amazon Music, across all devices. For example, if I download a movie from Prime on my tablet, watch some of it during my commute - when I get home and turn on Fire TV, I can pick up right where I left off from my tablet...seamlessly without having to manually sync.Comes with thousands of channels/apps loaded including all of the the major services we use.Can be used for games (we haven't tried any games yet)The voice command feature is outstanding. Speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it, with multiple options for buying, renting or just viewing for free if available. I've never been a big voice command user with other devices but this one works so well that using it has already become a habit.Using the Amazon Photos app you can instantly upload all of your digital photos from your phone or tablet to your Fire TV for large screen viewing of your photos.CONS: No way to customize the home screen layout (at least no way that I've been able to figure out).OVERALL: I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner. Since we use Prime and Amazon Music, its a no-brainer for us to use the Fire TV. Everything syncs automatically and transfers from device to device seamlessly.Edited to add the following section after reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews:If you are a first-time cord-cutter, considering cord-cutting or new to streaming TV services, here are a few things to keep in mind.1) Make sure you really take the time to do research and due-diligence on cord-cutting. Just google ""cord cutting"" to get started with several good articles. I'm seeing a lot of 1 and 2 star reviewers who seemed surprised that they actually have to pay for things like Netflix, Hulu, etc. Fire TV (and all of the other streaming services like Roku, Apple TV, etc.) do not just give you free access to all content. They allow you to pick and choose what you want to watch and pay for as opposed to making you pay a big fee for a huge amount of channels you will never watch. If you do it right, you'll have access to the content you want for a substantial savings over what you were paying with cable.2) Make sure you have a strong (and fast) internet connection. This is very important. We dumped our cable company in its entirety (including internet service) and upgraded to a faster dedicated line internet service with another company. We have up to six devices simultaneously streaming at any given time in our house and our internet service can handle all of that as well as the streaming Fire TV. So make sure yours can as well. If you're not sure, call your internet service provider, tell them you are planning to switch to streaming television and ask them about your current speeds.3) Some apps require a cable subscription. You can purchase a streaming service like Sling which will bundle several of the channels you likely want but you may find yourself unable to access certain apps. For now password sharing with one of your friends may solve that problem but I suspect its only a matter of time before that loophole gets closed. So do your research and make sure you can access the channels you want.4) Give yourself time to adjust to the new interface. It took some getting used to when I lost my ability to surf the cable channel guide. But the fact is, I'm no longer wasting large chunks of time mindlessly surfing the guide. Rather than surf, I'm turning to specific apps to watch specific programs. Its liberating in a way that I didn't expect. Besides, I can now surf all of the Amazon Prime content by simply using the voice command on the remote.",pos
Had this for a month now. Works perfect. Just saw an email informing me that it works with Echo devices now. Can't wait to try it.,pos
It was really easy to set up. A much more inexpensive alternative to cable television.,pos
Worked as expected. Was in stock and picking was fast.,pos
Fire tv is easy to set up and navigate. As seniors we were concerned about the ease of use.,pos
Picture quality is great and wide variety of features,pos
Alexa is the best choice in using your voice to change channels or request shows. The Amazon Fire also works with Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,pos
"Great for streaming. 4K capable , not as good as the nvidia shield but also less then half the price . Overall and excellent buy for the price.",pos
"Lots of options. If you are a prime member, you have a great selection of movies.",pos
Great product and would buy again. Awesome for streaming,pos
Love that we can have access to so many movies and tv shows!,pos
This is so worth it if you are tired of cable. Just can watch just about everything.,pos
The Fire TV has changed the way we watch television. We no longer have expensive cable and don't miss it at all,pos
I love my Amazon FireTV. Very easy to hook up! Very user friendly!,pos
"Friends at work had been telling me about the fire box and fire stick for quite some time. Finally decided to get one and glad I did. With Netflix, Amazon Video and specific channels, I think I'm going to cancel my cable subscription. Definitely recommend.",pos
Enjoying it not so easy to setup but once you get it all is good,pos
This is the box you want for 4k. If not get the regular stick.,pos
It's not as simple as cable but much cheaper and compact.,pos
"Great to watch movies, TV shows on Netflix, Amazon & Kodi.",pos
I'm using this instead of paying for a monthly satellite bill. It's worth it,pos
Love it.great addition to my 4K & Amazon Prime and unlimited music,pos
Fire TV works great for movies and tv shows. Download the KODI APP and open up 100s of movies and shows.,pos
By far the best media box out there . Absolutely no complaints . Does it intended job with an easy interface,pos
Makes watching Netflix shows at home easy if your tv doesn't have wifi capabilities.,pos
Works great and super fast compared to my old Firestick!,pos
"Tried the Firestick but was unhappy with processor and streaming quality. The Fire TV solved those problems. I like using Alexa, wish she could see content in PlayStation Vue app but otherwise this works great",pos
I cut off my cable and went for the streaming box finally .. have been happy with my purchase. no regrets,pos
This is by far the best streaming device I've ever owned!,pos
"I'm an Apple fan boy. Between my wife, daughter and me, we Have two minis, 2 mackbook airs, a pro, 3 iPads, and two iPhones, and an Apple Watch. We also have 3 apple TVsI retired my living room Apple TV after finding out all the cool stuff you can do with the fire stick. This is a must for anyone with a prime account since Apple TV doesn't allow amazon yet (heard the app will be there soon). The best part is modding it with fire tv guru.",pos
"Very easy to set up, took maybe 5 minutes. Quality and Service is great!!",pos
"Cut the cord! With this, able to stream using showtime anytime, HBO Go, amazon prime, netflix, and playstation vue. excellent interface. highly recommend!",pos
"Works just as well as my Rokus, however the interface is completely awful. Buy the fire for kodi buy a roku for everything else.",pos
Updated features are great and easy to use. Upgraded on the advice of Geek Squad when they came out to install a new TV. I highly recommend for those looking to cut the cord!,pos
"Works great, easy to setup, simple to navagate, layout and options are easily to use",pos
I used a lot of different streaming boxes over the years I've never had a lot of success with them until now these Amazon boxes are extremely well built and provide excellent content,pos
Set up really easy. We cancelled cable right away. Still figuring out which apps are for us. Got antenna for local channels.,pos
Amazon fire TV was easy to install and the content is great..,pos
"The fire box is very well made works great with amazon prime video and kodi. the only complaint i have is the remote doesn't have a on or off button,you have to buy a separate attachment for that.",pos
"No idea as I haven't opened it up yet. I bought it for my non smart TV and as a potential replacement for Xfinity cable box. From the reviews, it should work fine for what I intend to do with it.",pos
Having had a Roku as well the interface for the Fire TV far exceeds that of the Roku .,pos
I have 2 firestick and now the fire tv..i have it hooked to to my UHD tv and it's great.,pos
Much better than the stick. It allows you to plug directly into your router. Minimizes buffering by so much!!! Get this over the stick!!,pos
We recently dropped cable to save some money and this has been great. I literally can't think of a movie or tv show that I can't find on the FireTv.,pos
"I've purchased 5 within 3 months, amazing product. Have recommended it to all my family and friends.",pos
I had previously purchased the fire stick. It works good and had what you need. I bought the TV model. It's super fast. I love it and would highly recommend it!,pos
This is our second Amazon Fire TV. They are great and we've never had any issues with it. We really love the Amazon Prime membership as well.,pos
Easy to install and use. Great for streaming movies and getting Amazon movies.,pos
Since my apartment is paired with Echos and Echo Dots the Fire TV was a must have for my place. Not as sexy as an Apple TV but its UHD capability paired with my TVs made this a great addition.,pos
"Plugged everything in, using a network cable instead of wifi, and everything just works. The box is responsive, would be nice if the remote had tv volume options, but that's a small nitpick. Very happy with the purchase, it confirmed my decision to be a cord cutter and drop DirecTV.",pos
"This does 4k, Netflix, Hulu Amazon prime video, and Playstation Vue. Does it all and works flawlessly. Have used Amazon fire stick before and there is lag. No here with this product .",pos
This fire box is really saving me money from cable,pos
"I love this device. It is great for a device of its size,",pos
It's a good product I'm buy one more and another one for my room,pos
amazon tv is apple tv with half of the price of apple tv. With more functionality,pos
A must have to cut cable. It's very fast and reliable.,pos
I love this box I cut my cable and now use sling tv and am saving a ton,pos
"Although not as preferable as the gaming edition that we already owned, this model is also very nice. If you are looking to run KODI along with whatever build you may choose ex. Wookie a free build info found on YouTube or BeausBuild a paid build info found on FB or local to OKC. We are running both. One on this model and one on the gaming edition. Currently Amazon shows the gaming edition unavailable but we have been on a mad hunt for one more because it is faster and comes with a game controller making operation much easier. I would love for Best Buy to track down any remaining gaming units and make them available but overall this unit is an excellent choice and will run very smoothly with plenty of room for other applications.",pos
"I recently bought the Amazon TV because my PS3 was having difficulties streaming Playstation Vue. Therefore, the primary reason I bought it was to stream Playstation Vue. It works flawless. Additionally, after setting-up Playstation Vue, I began to download a ton of different apps and use it a lot more and for a lot more streaming services then I had originally planned. I would for sure recommend it for anyone wanting to stream any shows. It is a excellent device and easy to use.",pos
This Fire Stick Model has expanded memory for storing photos and your favorite music collections.I would highly recommend this item.,pos
Love it. Going to go back and get a couple of more for the rest of my tvs,pos
Great Amazon - Fire TV i am very satisfied with my unit,pos
Simply the best the fire stick is also a great deal but for flawless connectivity fire tv is worth the extra green backs.,pos
Such a better alternative than cable I am able to watch exactly what I want to watch without having to pay extra,pos
Fire TV streams shows and movies without buffering at all,pos
"We have both the Apple TV and now Fire Stick and I'd have to say that we use the fire stick more. It's user interface is pretty decent once you're use to it and the available apps are great. We honestly have no complaints about it. Also, you can do ""a lot more"" on these than the other smart devices that don't allow you to use third party apps. Nice to be able to customize your device the way you want, if you ask me.Easy setup and I actually really like the voice activated remote.",pos
Overall this unit does everything it is advertised to do. It's hard to review something when it works exactly as described. I've had no issues.,pos
Absolutely incredible ! A way better option then buying cable,pos
"Three star due to the fact that sometimes the fire tv remote doesn't work. I will then use my smart tv remote. Other than that issue, I would give five star.",pos
I enjoy my new Fire system and I'm glad I cut the cord.,pos
Easy to use. Great user interface and easy to set up,pos
No buffer issues and fast. Comes loaded with apps. Basically plug in and use.,pos
This new version of the amazon tv is awesome. Pretty easy to use.,pos
Bought this instead of getting another roku ultra that was giving me problems. This has a guide that roku doesn't and it shows you have a new recording if you have it in my shows,pos
"This box is the best,great apps,memory is powerful.Better than apple tv",pos
Has everything you need to live stream. I have 4 Apple TV and wish I would have know about the Fire TV first,pos
"Fast, reliable streaming. Haven't had any complaints",pos
"When we first purchased the Fire TV we watched all seasons of a particular TV show from Amazon Prime. It was great! We got ""hooked"" on the show and watched every episode. The Fire TV is great for this purpose. In addition, we have been watching movies that we normally would have to rent or purchase. Finally, we no longer have a cable TV service, which has saved us hundreds of dollars!",pos
Enjoy my Amazon fire tv box work great lots better than the fire stick no more buffering,pos
"Wish I would 've bought this sooner. I would get rid of cable if I could find a way to watch sports on it, but for everything else its great. would highly recommend.",pos
Really great for room not close to your internet router,pos
Got this so I could stream sling tv and get away from huge satellite bills. Works well and can stream everything I want. Just wish I had better internet provider.,pos
I use my fire tv daily and it performs perfectly. I have a smart tv but the fire tv runs much faster.,pos
"Easy to use, happy with purchase will recommend to anyone that is thinking on getting one user friendly.",pos
"The fire TV 4k is one of the best streaming devices I've ever owned. This version plays the media seamlessly. The 4k picture it displays is awesome. The only down side, there is no Vudu 4k.",pos
I like the $39.99 firestick better. This one does not have all the stuff the other one has and the sales clerk saud that it did.,pos
This was a great buy. I would recommend to everyone who likes to have tv options!,pos
"Fire TV out of the box is great but by adding protocols and search engines available on-line, you can turn your Fire TV into a dynamic and constantly evolving device that can find and play virtually any television show or movie that is available from anywhere in the world. It's especially good as a base platform for steaming services like Netflix, You Tube, etc.",pos
This device has been an amazing addition to my entertainment system,pos
LOVE MY ITEM AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THIS BEST BUY,pos
WE USE IT WITH DIRECT tv NOW AND ITS GREAT. wE HAVE IT HARD WIRED TO OUR ROUTER.,pos
"Streams great, I love using Alexa to play almost any song I can think of and the interface from the remote is very easy and reliable.",pos
The Firestick game me the experience I was looking for,pos
Upgraded my FireStickTV to the Fire TV box. Much happier with the direct connect versus Wi-Fi.,pos
Love my Fire TV. Very user friendly and I love the remote.,pos
"Wired internet connection is a little fast but still doesnt play higher resolution movies smoothly, especially 4k (i have 50mbps speed); could be due to slow server. For the price and infrequent use, i may just swap it for the cheaper firestick.",pos
"I just wish it had an optical audio out like the previous model so that's why it loses a star but in general, it's a cool device to stream movies etc.",pos
"No buffering, no lag, and does not freeze. Better than the FireTV stick or Roku.",pos
i am so in love with this item. it does exactly what it is supposed to do.,pos
Came in great packaging. Everything is there. Works great!,pos
This has been a great addition to my media collection. Youtube in 4k looks awesome!,pos
We have only had our fire stick for a few weeks but we love it so far! There's so many options and the quality is wonderful.,pos
Works faster then the stick. I have both. Runs smooth,pos
who would not love this product when it is so simple to use and you will get hours of enjoyment from it.,pos
Works great for all my steaming needs. I was able to transform my non smart tv.,pos
"This purchase by far has been one of the best made by me this year. Set up was easy, and the content was plentiful. Well worth the price.",pos
This is an easy wHen to cut your cable bill and easy to set up. Programming is as easy as using your smartphone.,pos
Great product for watching movies or using with kodi doesn't heat up as quickly as the smaller firestick,pos
"I purchased this versus the regular FireStick because I have a 4K TV and I must say, the quality is amazing even after applying KODI. I love this product",pos
"This is even better than the firesticks, of you have 4k TV, you can't go wrong!",pos
"There are many apps for the fire box, and there are many uses. The picture is very crisp and set up in a breeze.",pos
Better than the stick 2 x the memory and speed great for streaming,pos
"Love being able to access all the apps we stream from. Like the voice remote, can be a real time saver especially when you can't remember which app the show you want top watch is on.",pos
Amazon tv is a great item! I love the fact that it can stream in 4K!,pos
Easy to use and good quality .....................,pos
After reviewing all of the brands out there. I decided on the fireTv box.,pos
Amazon FireTV is a powerful little box. Worth the extra money over the Firestick. Great interface. Can connect your phone and type input. Alexa capability too.,pos
Very easy to use but lags bad. Would recommend the box.,pos
Not a bad product but you only need this if your streaming or viewing 4k content on a 4k tv,pos
This is great for watching Amazon original shows and free tv,pos
Goodbye outrageous satellite bills...hello Amazon!,pos
Differently recommend. Easy to install and ease of use.,pos
Tons of things you can do with this. Highly recommend it.,pos
I bought my fire tv last month and I like it sofar. I can use alexa on remote control not even to search in tv programs I can ask every question. for some reason YouTube app isn't installed by default and there is no web browsing app installed by default. The default country address is Turkey and if you don't change it you can not install some apps because of restrictions!!! Installing apps is tricky for some apps. I think it'd be nice to have more flexibility on software aspects of this device. Other than that I like everything about it.,pos
A great way to start cutting the cable cord. Might have to buy another.,pos
"This replaced an original fire stick. It works good enough for us to cancel our cable tv. If it's not Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, or the antenna we don't need to see it.",pos
Read the reviews and thought I would give the device a try. Works great. No buffering issues and picture quality is excellent.,pos
its the best way to watch tv and movies it has everything you need,pos
"This device works great for streaming TV. I use it with PlayStation Vue, just download the app and you are ready to go. Easy to use and Alexa helps out.",pos
Amazon fire has made a great product with this one!,pos
I got this to try out cutting the cable. Being an Amazon Prime member I knew that I had some content already available but there are so many options when you get to looking. I really like the Ethernet port that I can hard wire from my modem to make sure that I am running at max speeds.,pos
"The Amazon Fire TV is a tiny, premium quality box that connects to any TV with an HDMI cable & provides the most intuitive & powerful interface for Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu & many more.LIKES: 1- Small, unobtrusive size 2- User friendly remote 3- Internal memory is 2Gb Flash, 16Gb Storage + Micro SD Card slot that accommodates up to 128Gb external storage! 4- Ethernet or WiFi connected. Ethernet will provide a more robust signal than WiFi, to reduce the buffering so commonly seen on lesser boxes. 5- Very easy to use6- Beautiful on screen interface / graphics7- 4K Ultra HD capable 8- You can download and save apps, movies & music on the optional external storage card 9- Voice Search on the Remote lets you speak a movie, actor, title, etc. & let the search begin!10- Alexa can search your photos & can even look for a specific individual in the photos by name DISLIKES: None! COMPARE to AMAZON FIRE STICK: The Fire Stick is a very inexpensive device that is WiFi only & has 1/2 the Flash & Memory as this Fire TV. It has no provision to add additional memory. The Fire TV connects with Ethernet cable or WiFi. Ethernet provides a much faster & stronger signal, so your movies don't freeze up. With 2X the Flash & Memory of Fire Stick + an external memory slot, the Fire TV makes skipping & frozen movies a thing of the past. CONCLUSION: I recommend a Fire TV for every HDTV you own! It is truly an amazing device & converts your existing TV, whether a Smart TV or not, to a VERY Smart TV!",pos
This is good item to watch program with out all expense,pos
"It was very simple to open, put together, install and begin watching my favorite shows. I highly recommend this box.",pos
Everything you need with this little box. Get yours today!,pos
"Was looking for a device that I can load Kodi on. This Fire TV is more than capable of doing what I needed it for!!! So glad that they were sold out of the fire stick when I was looking for it, the extra memory on the Fire TV is coming in handy",pos
These boxes are must faster than the stock and have more memory. They are not bulky which is nice. The fire stick seems to overheat and I haven't had that problem with the box.,pos
"The Amazon Fire TV was an excellent purchase. I do not regret canceling cable TV. Streaming Hulu, Showtime, Netflix when I want. You can't beat it.",pos
"Works great, I love it, best streaming box I've ever had.",pos
I am able to watch anything I want with the fire stick and it is so easy to use... I love it!,pos
Nice product easy to use. Enjoy it very much watching shows with the family.,pos
Really really really really really really awesome.,pos
It does what is says it does on the box. In this day and age that is something to take note of.,pos
"This is the best streaming device for anyone. You can use any of your streaming accounts. Netflix,Hulu,Kodi. You will not be disappointed",pos
"I was a long time apple tv user but recently cut ties with the cable company and got sling and didn't want to shell out more for another apple tv. I have had my Fire TV for a few weeks now and love it, I haven't really used the voice controls that often but it works great. I would definitely recommend it especially if you are using Kodi.",pos
"I was looking to purchase the Fire TV stick or the Fire TV. I got the FIre TV on Black Friday. My friend purchased the Fire TV stick and I was impressed with the capabilities it provided. When I saw the Fire TV on sale, I decided to give it a try and I was really impressed with the speed with just going through the menu and the apps. I would definitely recommend this product who is looking for a media player. There is a lot of app options to get.",pos
I purchased this for Christmas.it was easy to set up and am now looking to purchase more for the other rooms.,pos
Love all the shows with no commercials. Soon i will save more money by canceling cable TV.,pos
Ive cut the cable cord thanks to the firestick! !!,pos

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",pos

"Easy to use, providing many options and ability for add-ons, really great!",pos
very user friendly. my daughter has no problem navigating around to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime,pos
Perfect for the cord cutter. Very easy setup and user interface. Can add games and most apps for Android based.,pos
Awesome and reasonable. This Fire TV box packs enough punch for your viewing with more than adequate content.That it will knock you out.And for a REA$ONABLE PRICE. That you can afford.,pos
I use this to access my Amazon Prime movies and Netflix. I like it.,pos
"For little more money than the firestick, you will get lan hard connection as well as wireless and 4k compatibility. Also provides faster processor for load times.",pos
Perfect compact and powerful.. The Amazon Fire Tv is an amazing piece of hardware.,pos
I already have an Amazon Fire Stick and wanted another. I decided to try the Amazon TV. I can say it is much faster in loading both games and shows.,pos
Cancelled my dtv and this is everything 8 hoped for,pos
These things are great if you don't want to pay high cable bills and have a prime account.,pos
I use it mainly for sling but I do so much more with it and I love the remote that I can speak to Alexa,pos
"I love the fire tv and it has a much faster processing speed than the fire stick, which I also own. I also like that the fire tv allows you to connect to all of my other accounts like Netflix, HBOgo, etc.",pos
"I have the Fire Stick and added the Fire TV. The Fire TV is noticeable faster than the Fire Stick and more reliable. If you like the Amazon interface, which I do, go for the speed.",pos
This amazon fire tv is a excellent product the box is very Small sitting next to the TVs . The fire tv cost a little more than the stick BUT the processor is must faster.,pos
This is by far something great to stream and the programs you can download to it are great. Worth the money if you know what you know what you are using it for.,pos
"I wish you could keep DVR longer, but otherwise good.",pos
"This is my first streaming video device, and I did a good bit of research before buying. The video quality is excellent and the operator interface is easy to use.",pos
I enjoy my fire tv I would definitely recommend it,pos
"We cut our cable in hopes to just use this product. However, we cannot view most things without logging into a cable source. So now it just collects dust. I guess if it was ""jail broken"" it might be better.",neg
I love the Amazon Fire TV. This is a great device!,pos
Amazon is always producing great products for a affordable price.,pos
I have been trying to cut the cord on cable/dish for a while now. This definitely makes it much easier and I'm saving a few bucks. However it does have some glitches. Every once and while it will freeze but it is very uncommon and could be my internet and not the box. I can't dock it too many stars. Would still recommend.,pos
Great device! Connects quickly and easy to set up.,pos
Love this fire stick and the ability to display a much crisper and clearer picture,pos
This is the best streaming device I have purchased yet. Hooks to Ethernet and is lightning fast!,pos
Quad core processing and the extra RAM makes this device really fast and the GUI makes it easy to use.,pos
I'm not to Happy with product. Very cheap .I wouldn't recommend it anyone,neg
I love my Firebox along with Alex I can ask almost anything and Alex will let me know,pos
"Excellent Picture, speed and overall quality. Movie selections range from 50's to date. UHD is the reason I made this purchase.",pos
I wanted to find away to get rid of my extra cable boxes and that was it. It gives me even more than my smart devices.,pos
The device is one of the best especially if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber. The Amazon Prime Music on the FireTV is the best music streaming device. The only issue I had is that the remote controler stopped working and I had to use the firetv app on my phone to control the device.,pos
I would definitely recommend this for everyone. It is awesome.,pos
Love this set up. More movies and TV than I can watch.,pos
I no longer have cable nor do I need it now that I have the firestick!,pos
"Easy to install, easy to use. Even the kids can handle it.",pos
This is one of the best products I use in such a long time not only you could watch live television and movies you can catch up with the shows do you like both international and domestic,pos
"I love my fire stick movies , music, even movies that just came out are all free wow this is the best Valentines Gift ever and for all ages to enjoy so get yours today",pos
Much better than the stick. 4K works great and having an Ethernet Jack is greatly appreciated. Snappy menus.,pos
I love my fireTV! We have a firestick in every room and added the firetv box to our new 4k TV. Awesome,pos
We love it kids n all everyday use for us we don't use cable as much ch as b4,pos
"Fire tv box is awesome I use it everyday love streaming 4k content. Super smooth streaming, especially comes with Alexa. It's a must have never need a cable box or dvr again. Add an sd card and plenty of room for games all your apps.",pos
"The Amazon Fire TV saved me from having to buy a new TV. My 2011 Samsung no longer supported HBO Go and other apps. Amazon Fire TV allows me to watch that and literally hundreds more channels and apps. Most are free, some you have to pay for. Easy to install and easy to use!",pos
"After dropping by the local store several times and finding they were out of stock, I found one on the shelf!Great product, easy set-up and works great. KODI installed without any issues.",pos
"Like it great apps selection.....,................",pos
I recommend this item and it works great. Go for it.,pos
It nice and simple clean looks nice.I'm really glad the bestbuy rep suggested,pos
I'm a repeat buyer on this item many times over for all my family members. It is fast and much better then firesticks and we'll worth the difference in price.,pos
seriously.... it's great and you should have one!!,pos
On the way away from cable ! Cable has increased in price for not any thing new .,pos
"I purchased the Amazon FireTV to access Playstation Vue, thereby reducing my monthly cost of viewing from $130.86 to $35 (other package viewing options available at affordable costs). The FireTV is 4K compatible providing a great picture with my 4K and non-4K TVs, no noticeable lag time with transition between channels or other options, and it can be used for cost effective/free streaming. I now have more very affordable viewing options than I ever had! I love the Amazon FireTV and would definitely recommend it to anyone!",pos
firstly when I installed it. felt not much things to do with fire tv. but I am getting new features everyday by googling. a lots lots lots of features. I am enjoying mirroring feature of the product now.,pos
Currently enjoying the learning experience. We have not dived whole-heartedly into the many channel options,pos
I love the fire box. All of my shows are easily accessible.,pos
Very nice streaming device. Very smooth and super fast. Very minimal glitches.,pos
Best product out on the market. I no longer need cable .. must have,pos
"This is the best affordable streaming player. Easy to use, and the voice remote just adds to the experience.",pos
Had the fire TV stick and this is much faster with better picture quality.,pos
"From the moment I set up the box I have not had any problems, I restart it from time to time being that it's a small computer so to speak.",pos
Good product. Get rid of one of my extra Comcast boxes so I'm down to one. You can use your Comcast subscription to get live streaming of certain channels. Eventually I will ditch cable completely but this is a good start,pos
Very pleased with this product. I am now thinking about cutting the cable company out!,pos
Easy to start using and a fun approach to choosing the right program to watch. I am enjoying sharing with friends.,pos
I am so glad I purchased these. We can get all of our favorite movies!!!!,pos
Easy to setup and many addons to use.I now use my fire more than my tv.,pos

Fire tv is fast and easy to use. It is easy to navigate.,pos
I am happy I decided to go with buying the Firebox I'd first decided to buy a fire stick until I had read more about Firebox and all the other operations it has functionality it has compared to the fire stick it was a no-brainer.,pos
"I got in on the initial deal with DirecTV Now and after the frustration of dealing with the Apple TV I received for free with the service, I tried this box. What a difference. It streams 4K (yes I have a 4K TV) and performs everything fast. It also has all of the services I use. Forget the Apple junk and pick this up!",pos
"I love this product, is excellent for my 4K video streaming. Really easy to use and a great price.",pos
Perfect for somebody who doesn't want to pay for cable or turn their tv into a smart tv,pos
Nothing comes close. So much faster then anything else out there.,pos

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",pos

"I was surprised at how much I like this amazon fire tv. I own a Apple TV and a roku. I really like it because I have amazon prime and amazon unlimited music and this really makes those services shine! It's nice to watch the prime provided content, movies, tv shows, and amazon original series. The Alexa inabled remote is also very nice.",pos
I bought this product to add to my TV in the family room. Great buy,pos
We like watching movies and tv shows on the fire stick,pos
Great product! Easy setup and easy navigation. Recommended,pos
Great for cord cutting. Just needs a little cleaning up to do. Sorting through the content can be a little confusing.,pos
"Product was a bit difficult to set up but my tech savvy daughter assisted. Once it was set up, it worked perfectly. Love the programming only no local channels.",pos
"The first one had a lag with the remote as it would randomly stop working but once I replaced it, it worked just fine.",pos
"It is very easy to set up and helps in delivering a better streaming experience. It was so good, I bought a second one.",pos
Great way to get awesome content without having cable. HIGHLY recommended but not for beginners UNLESS you are good with YouTube.,pos
"This is my 2nd FireTV I now own, and love them both. Setup was a snap even without it preconfigured from Amazon.",pos
I bought this to run Playstation VUE on. No problems with the unit.,pos
"I replaced this with a fire stick hoping it would be faster, and it definitely is. It keeps apps opened to where you last left them, no more loading the app every time you turn on your tv. Well worth the extra $55.",pos
Very easy to install and use. Will be saving us money in the future.,pos
"This does anything you can imagine, you really don't need cable",pos
"I recently replaced a Xiaomi Mi Box, with this Fire TV box, and its been nothing short of excellent content availability and flawless performance, it just works great, should have bought this in the first place, instead of cheaping out with the Mi Box.",pos
Upgraded from the fire stick and the picture is noticeably better. The quality and speed of streaming is much quicker.,pos
I have an Amazon ECHO and the Fire TV integrates nicely with the ECHO. The Amazon TV is faster than the FIRE STICK as it has memory to buffer streaming video and present it in what appears to be real time,pos
"The product is as advertised. I have good internet and it works great. Was able to ""cut the cord"" and save a good bit of money.",pos
All my friends had the Amazon Fire Stick but I was not sold on streaming video since am a crazed videophile. When I read about the FireTV I decided I was ready to try it out. I must say that I've become a huge fan of YouTube and the video quality of some content in 4k is amazing. This is a good upgrade over the FireStick.,pos
"Best thing invented. Love my Amazon stick, everyone should have one.",pos
"Great quality, fun games for free, but NO free programming!",neg
Great product for what it is designed for. Easily modified for Kodi,pos
"I have owned the apple TV 1,2 gen; Amazon fire stick, direct computer to tv hookup via hdmi cable, roku and none compare to the performance and GUI of this product.",pos
"This little device is impressive. Easy to install and simple to navigate. I own both the Fire TV and the Fire Stick. The Fire TV is slightly quicker at responding to input, but not so much that it's a deal breaker. The Stick is great for taking with you on the road. Both devices are a great value. No complaints whatsoever.",pos
Easy to install and use. The only cable not cut is internet.,pos
"I own a firestick, so I decided to invest in a Amazon Fire TV box. It streams my movies really well and the picture quality is great. I really love my Fire TV box and I am recommending the Fire TV box to my family and friends. I do not regret this purchase.",pos
"Still getting use to using it,having trouble getting programs we like to watch",pos
Love the options it gives me for minimal cost . I carry it with me when I travel. .,pos
Wanted to cut the cable cord and heard from friends about fire tv. Gave it a go and so glad I did. We love the programming and we pay for the shows we want instead of overpaying for cable. Would highly recommend fire tv,pos
First off this is cheaper than the Apple TV and it's better 10 fold and also it's able to play 4K format if you have a 4K tv it's got a sd card slot and you can plug a PS4 control through the USB it also has and use the PS4 remote to control the device and play the amazon games 2 it's awesome period buy it!!!!!!,pos
"Since I am a prime member, this fits perfectly into our tv watching lineup.",pos
"Great little device it reacts fast to the remote and is faster than the fire stick, if you thinking about getting one get the fire TV instead of the stick.",pos
"I enjoy being able to view all the online videos that are out there. This allows me to view everything I could imagine with the added ability to view videos that I have ripped from my dvd collection. I didn't give it a 5 because I can only figure out how to view movies on the Micro SD card not the included USB connection and it tends to abort after an hour or so on a couple of movies I wanted to watch. Not sure why, others are fine.",pos
Better performance and clarity than the Amazon fire stick.,pos
Very pleased with this product after downloading Kodiak and the Exodus add-ons. Since then I have added numerous add-ons just like getting apps from an app store. It's well worth the cost and I haven't even bothered to maximize the potential of this little critter yet.,pos
This is the best purchase. It has everything and 4k is amazing,pos
"I had been researching ways to forego using cable television in the future and it seems this was good start. Haven't quite figured it all out yet but so far, so good.",pos
The Fire TV was easy to set-up and we have had no problems. I do suggest unplugging when not in use as the box does heat up...just to be safe.,pos
The fire stick makes getting movies at home a breeze. Most movies can be seen in HD format from your living room.,pos
This unit with amazon prime is a blast! Use it to have fun dance parties...,pos
"WE PURCHASED THIS IN PLACE OF PAYING THE SKY HIGH CABLE PRICES FOR CHANNELS THAT WE JUST DO NOT USE. OUR TV IS A ROKU SMART TV, BUT WE FOUND THAT WE STILL NEEDED THIS TO GAIN ACCESS TO A FEW STATIONS. WE HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH OUR PURCHASE.",pos
I'm really impressed by the amount of expansion you can put in with a micro SD card for extra storage .,pos
"Bottom Line: You can stream TV from anywhere. This allows you to bring HD Television Home. Become an Amazon Prime member, its worth it. Prime allows Movies, Music and Shows into your handheld device and home. Never miss your favorite programs.",pos
"I have the Fire Stick and it did not support 4K, so I purchased the Fire TV with my new 4K TV and this unit performs better than my Fire Stick. There is not much waiting between clicks and it supports 4K!",pos
Great product. I bought both the Fire TV and the Fire Stick. The stick is going back and I'm going to buy more of these for the rest of the house.,pos
The amazon fire tv is awesome. You can find any tv show or any movie you want from any year old or new.,pos
Best thing that I purchased in a while. I love it.,pos
"THE FIRE TV WAS SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO USE CABLE OR SATELLITE AND IT""S WORKING.",pos
"The Amazon Fire TV is definitely one of the top media streamers on the market today. It allows for 4K playback which only a few other devices can do, ethernet port to get the most reliable streaming speed, and an expandable external storage port so you will have plenty of room for all of your apps. If you are will to pay a little extra for this it is definitely going to be worth it in the end",pos
"So far so good,no problems and would recommend to everyone. Has crisp clear pictures and easy to navigate around without help or instruction manual.",pos
I'm very excited to say I love my fire stick. I've waited for this a long time. My neighbors say they are so happy,pos
It's fast compared to the Firestick. The only issue I see is the remote becomes unresponsive sometimes.,pos
easy to install. very nice but hopefully it will be cheaper.,pos
"After having been an Apple TV user (the older versions, of which I have 2) I decided to go with the amazon product because this one supports fox sports. That's the only reason I chose it. But after using it I have no complaints at all. I haven't yet looked into streaming from mobile device to it yet, not sure if it's possible or not. Either way I'd recommend this to anyone looking to buy one of these devices.",pos
I like the product work vey well and I am very happy with it.,pos
Bought to use Sling. It works decent. Glitches sometimes but overall worth it.,pos
So much faster then the stick. Worth the extra money,pos

It works wonderfully. Works faster than the first generation.,pos
"I had purchased an Apple TV, most recent generation, and hated it. The touch screen was too touchy, and ultimately it just never functioned properly so I returned it (to Costco). Instead, I bought this product because it had all of the online channels (except Apple TV but who cares) and it has Alexa, which frankly is better than Siri (and I say that despite being very pro Apple).",pos
This a 4k amazon fire for 4k TVs. The image is just fantastic!,pos
I have an Apple TV and The Amazon fire dreaming fire station much more.,pos
Love this device! Processor is fast enough to stream Netflix & Hulu without buffering but also has enough memory for the kids to download games and pandora and their apps that the love. Pay the extra $$$ and get a quality streaming device.,pos
"I'm currently living in Korea and needed American television to keep me entertained. I had Kodi installed on a FireStick, however, despite having a 100Mbps service plan, my wireless connection couldn't keep up with the bandwidth hungry programming. My solution was to purchase the FireTV and hardwire my internet connection via ethernet. The difference was immediately noticeable, I haven't had any buffering issues and programs load up immediately. I would definitely recommend this device if you live in an apartment where the air is saturated with WIFI signals and plan on using bandwidth heavy applications such as Kodi. The ethernet connection ensures that you are getting a clean signal and using the maximum bandwidth speed of your ISP.",pos
So far this has been a great product for us. We've been able to cancel our uverse and still watch al of our favorite shows.,pos
"Good product, easy to set up and to use! I purchased it to have DTV Now on a 2nd tv and I received a Apple box from DTV , I like the Amazon box better than the Apple box , more user friendly.",pos
Works very well. Compatable with lots of programs.,pos
It works. Not as user friendly as roku. Not as many apps as roku. No google play store.,pos
I absolutely love it. Cut my cable bill in half. So many movies and stations I would never have dreamed of trying,pos
"Love it, had the stick and it was kinda slow navigating. This one is much faster. Was going to use this and cancel cable. When I told my cable company I wanted to cancel and I was just going to stream everything they cut my bundle cost by $100. I kept cable but I also still use my firetv alot.",pos
The stick offers one of the best options if your trying to ween off the cable providers. Great offers,pos
Best streaming device on the market and flawless 4K streaming without the restrictions of Apple TV,pos
This version of it is harder to use. Prefer old one,neg
Need to get rid of cable.... one step closer. Great content.,pos
I have owned all the past generations of fire stick and this blows them out of the water.,pos
"These things are the perfect box for streaming shows, with a voice activating remote.",pos
"I think this is faster and more reliable than the firestick, no drop outs",pos
"The picture quality is very close to the Roku ultra.I love the alexa,but it is a little bit of a gimmick",pos
"A little nervous about buying this product online since I always buy in store products, but this was the best service I could ask for. I was able to follow my order at anytime . The order was received quickly and without any hassles.",pos
"Great item, this is very useful and it is hard to come by.",pos
I have an amazon account and with the fire tv I am able to watch everything,pos
I only use Amazon products for streaming and I always recommend them to my friends & acquaintances as well.,pos
"With an HD antenna and Fire TV, we said goodbye to the cable company. Everything you want to watch for a fraction of the price.",pos
"I have a smart tv but the speed with which the apps work leaves a lot to be desired. I bought the Amazon Fire tv because having Amazon prime allows me to watch tons of shows and movies for free and the selection of available apps is great. The only drawback I noticed is that Vudu cannot be installed but I do have that on my smart tv so it's not a big issue. The remote of the Fire tv works via bluetooth so the box can be hidden away and out of sight which is great. Overall, a very solid streaming box.",pos
"Excellent. Nice solution to non smart device. If you use with a smart tv, the tv remote will also run Amazon TV. We use it with a projector and usb audio for the sound.",pos
"The Amazon fire TV is perfect for those looking to cut the cord. It can connect through wifi or through an ethernet cable, which works awesome and I don't get buffering. Plus 4k streaming, better processor and more memory is an upgrade compared to the Fire Stick. I ended up cancelling my DirectTV a while ago and haven't looked back. Compared to what I was paying with satellite subscription, this is very cheap. I already have Amazon Prime, so I get their streaming service and also have Netflix and Hulu. This is perfect for my family and my needs .",pos
Purchased this Fire TV box mainly to watch PlayStation Vue and it works perfectly with the service. Amazon Prime works great too as expected. No buffering or lag while streaming. Highly recommended.,pos
I cut the cable and my bill with ooma for phone is 84$ a month for triple play,pos
I love this product it is well worth the money that I paid for it.,pos
Its an okay product. It is geared towards amazon users. Doesn't have apps that roku or apple tv have. I got it for the direct now and it froze every time I used it.,pos
This thing is AWE... wait for it... SOME. Don't like cable? Buy this thing immediately!,pos
"great response time, image quality is fantastic, easy to navigate",pos
This is my second fire tv. It is a solid device with user friendly interface and remote. I would recommend over Roku and AppleTV.,pos
"Sweet product by Amazon, as usual. It's legit, most definitely",pos
you can access thousands of movies and TV shows instantly. access weather and sports updates using the Alexa voice search function.,pos
I'm an Amazon Prime & Netflix costumer and I just love this thing. I no longer have Comcast TV only antenna and two Fire TV's. Absolutely love it. It's fast as long as my internet is good.,pos
Super device to turn any TV into Smart TV. Really good device.,pos
It does what it's supposed to do very minimal freezing second or two on occasion,pos
Must have device..... having movies in 4K is great,pos
The Fire TV 4K shows great tv in 4K. I also own firesticks and they are great also. I purchased the Fire TV basically for the 4K and I'm not disappointed.,pos

"Performs much better than our old Roku and the Firestick! Seems to be way faster, much clearer w/ no buffering issues. I just wish it came with a qwerty keyboard.",pos
The Fire TV box works great. We were looking for a device that streams DirecTV Now and this device was significantly less than a competing device that offered the service. We liked the first one so much we bought a second one.,pos
I fabulous way to incorporate smart tv technology into a well performing pre smart tv. Great functions and great sound. Blows away Apple TV!!,pos
Broke away from cable and Direct tv and all there fees and high prices. Got the fire TV to do this.,pos
The fire stick makes great gifts for family and friends and especially college students.,pos
Purchased the Amazon Fire Box to enjoy movies. I really love the device. I am looking forward to purchasing another.,pos
I now have access to many free movies and TV shows with the provided apps and have additional viewing choices with subscriptions to Netflix and MLBTV. It has turned my regular TV into a smart set.,pos
If you like movies it's worth it. Had to have a friend help us set it up but it works great,pos
I can watch a ton of shows now with this. Well worth the money,pos
This is way better than the amazon fire stick. I would recommend in any day over it,pos
This is by far one of the best investments ever. I got rid of my TV service.,pos
Once you get a stable and reliable internet you're good to go !,pos
This is a great movie box. Subscribe to Amazon and you'll have access to tons of content. Games are cool addition also.,pos
"This device is great for watching tv shows, movies, or sports without having to be locked in a subscription.",pos
This TV is on another level from the firestick or chromecast. Speeds are amazing and can handle anything we try to stream. Great Purchase!,pos
It was a awesome gift to give to someone special to enjoy,pos
Exactly what was expected. Ease of setup is a definite plus and you can't beat the price for a streaming device.,pos
I bought this and like it very much also love doing business with best buy I will buy from best buy from now on.,pos
"This device has changed my marriage for the good!! Me and my wife have been glued to the tube, cuddling every night...",pos
This was an easy purchase over the Internet and store pick up. I like the fire over the fire stick. You get more ram and can side load apps with micro SD card.,pos
"I recommend this product to all!Easy to use.Lots of shows, movies and apps to watch. Great buy for all ages.",pos
this equipment will help us with our viewing of movies that we want.,pos
I'm still adjusting to all its benefits. easy setup.,pos
Great item. Timely transaction. 2 thumbs up! GREAT,pos
The Amazon Fire TV Fred me from high monthly bills and provide a huge variety of older programming.,pos
Unbelievable quality for a great price. Easy to set up and awesome customer support.,pos
Being a newby at this internet stuff is easier after the first 30 days of free trial. Has been down once via the company still working on issues.,pos
Setting up today with wall bracket to make television fit better in the room,pos
I bought it it works. What's else do you want. Yes I would get another one if needed,pos
It appears to be much faster than the firestick. I can access movies without it having to buffer.,pos
Great item to have but a little more than the fire stick,pos
"I bought this because it has more storage space, it is easy to set up. I like the SD card option to expand the storage and it has a USB port so if I wanted to I could add an external hard drive.",pos
It works as advirtized and. Best Buy had it in stock at my nearest store,pos
Enjoyed the firesticks for a while but was tired of how much buffering time it took because of Wifi. Spending the extra $40 to plug this directly into the modem was well worth it. Haven't had a buffering issue at all. 1080P full movies load and play in a matter of seconds!!,pos
I purchased a fire tv a few weeks ago and love it. This device was easy to setup and has more features than I ever expected. The family is enjoying it.,pos
"recommend it to anyone, always find something good to watch and very portable.",pos
This box provides a wonderful image on my 4K Samsung TV. The program content is extraordinary. You can install whatever apps your heart desires and see virtually the world.,pos
I love this thing it does everything you can even play games on it,pos
"Great product.""You tube"" how much you can do with this box.",pos
Better then advertised and am amazed with the quality/ performance,pos
I really enjoy the fire tv and all the perks that come along with having fire tv such as the variety of free subscriptions and many options to choose from,pos
I absolutely love my new Fire TV!! I am an Amazon Prime member and having the capability to whats all of my Amazon products and having the capability of using Netflix and other streaming apps at my fingertips is amazing!! Highly recommend this!!!,pos
"If you stream everyday, it is worth the investment for the 4k box vs the fire stick. More powerful, more storage, more time to watch with less loading times.",pos
I would recommend this to anyone that loves watching movies.,pos
I can move my fireTV from set to set and room to room with no problems. It works great for my needs.,pos
Great device! Has all apps avaliable in one box! Would recommend this for anyone!,pos
"This has been one of the best ""set-top box"" replacement experiences ever. I love that it combines all available online video contents in one. Great interface and very stable too!",pos
Does it job and hope amazon keeps adding more apps,pos
I bought this for my son for his room since he didn't want to spend the extra money for a cable box...he really likes this and is getting a lot of use out of it.,pos
i would and have told people to get one if they have a 4k tv,pos
"The ease of use is great, the features are great, Alexa Voice command works great, very pleased with the Amazon Fire Tv Box. AA",pos
Works well and easily portable. Worth the money...,pos
This device is faster than the firestick by far. Remote is responsive and when you click something it opens right away. Love the fact that it has ethernet which is a game changer when streaming.,pos
I have no idea why I did not buy this any sooner! Works awesome!,pos
Absolutely love the fire Tv. I first purchased the fire stick which does just what it should but the fire Tv is awesome. Faster bigger.,pos
Fire tv is awesome!! Go get it now!! Way better then the fire stick! Also get the game remote...lots of free downloads!,pos
Great box I like all the features for itHighly recomend,pos
Works great. Was easy to set up and has great quality output and plenty of apps that can run on it Only complaint is too much focus on Amazon content.,pos
FireTV is intuitive and fast. We had both a FireTV and a Fire Stick. We returned the Fire Stick because it seemed to lag a lot. Both FireTV units work well. It allows us to use PlayStation Vue as our primary live TV. A combination of PS Vue and free over the air TV (OTA with indoor antenna) allowed us to cut the cable. We did upgrade our internet as Centurylink offered a free upgrade to 40 mbps. This eliminated buffering on programs when multiple units were in use. We are very happy with the quality of picture and the channels. We will save a lot of money over time and the TV experience is great. We also like the free On Demand programming. Very pleased with this product.,pos
Fire TV is faster than the Fire stick. If you can afford the difference it is worth it.,pos
"The Amazon Fire tv is awesome. Anything and everything you could imagine at your fingertips to watch. If you are on the fence about the purchase , I highly recommend this to anyone. It's a great item.",pos
"Bought to play my PlayStation Vue tv, love the Alexus feature overall a great thing for steaming.",pos
"Great item, did away with cable. I need to purchase 4 more.",pos
The fire tv does not display in 4k.. it processes in 4k but cant display 4k.. This is because of the dumb design.. It still has a 1.14 HDMI port.. you need at least a 2.0 dvd port to receive a 4k signal.. You wont be able to tell until you hit your tv display resolution.. there you will see it still displaying in 1080p.,neg
Excellent streaming box - Easy to setup & Use! Performs great either hard wired or running on Wi-Fi. There are both free apps and paid apps to help save on cable costs! Works perfect with your Amazon Prime membership! Would totally recommend!,pos
The Fire TV box has USB that allows PS4 controller to be connected for games and emulators. Also option to add SD card storage as well as USB. No brainer and recommended!,pos
"Highly recommend buying this product. We were purchasing cable through our cable co. and paying nearly $200 for a bundled plan. And we hardly have time to even watch live television! But with this device we are able to catch up on programs, series, news and our favorite movies at our leisure and pause and pick up whenever we want. And after searching other sites and stores we found that Best Buy has the best price overall. And super great customer service as well.",pos
great product for entertainment and having all your accounts in one,pos
"I love the Amazon Fire TV. It is easy to use and setup. I use this almost everyday. Trying to cut the cord, this makes it easy to do.",pos
some channels don't come in as clear as others but most are pretty good,pos
One of the best streaming services out there amazon fire tv is a great product.,pos
Works as it should and gives us the ability to stream 4K.,pos
"I heard so much about fire TV and went out and bought it at the local Best Buy store and i must say that I'm very happy with my new fire TV the movie selection is great, now i can watch what i want when i want.",pos
I love it everything is in one place. I do recommend buying this you will not be upset,pos
"Great product, great service and best item I have purchased in years.",pos
love the fire tv . best buy shipping is great very fast ship.,pos
I highly recommend the firestick to any user. Great for any age,pos
"I bought one Fire TV just to test out ""cutting the cable"" and start streaming TV. I was so impressed with Amazon's Fire TV that I bought a second one for the bedroom. Small, easy to setup, full featured and fast.",pos
Works well. No problems with this item. Easy to set up.,pos
this unit is so much better then the first gen faster and 5 stars,pos
"Have only been using the Amazon TV for a few months now and so far have been very satisfied. Simple to use, it walks you through the setup and provides access to lots of apps and streaming video services.",pos
"We purchased 2 of these for a couple of reasons. One because we were already Amazon Prime members and the other was paying too much for cable TV. Weve had them now for approx a month (one in the living room and one in the bedroom) and they work flawlessly. Easy set up (again if you're a Prime Member, just follow the on screen directions. We also subscribed to Sling TV for those channels we still wanted and purchased an outdoor antenna for locals. Fire TV has all the apps ready so they make it easy to set up what you want to watch. It can take a little getting used to apps instead of the TV guide on cable but if you have a smart phone its very similar. The Fire TV will not work with a standard IR remote so you have to use their remote provided but if you want to use only one remote for everything then I highly recommend the Logitech hub system that will control everything including the Fire TV. I have a TV, Blue Ray, Fire TV all connected through HDMI in my receiver and only have to use the one Logitech remote. Make sure you get the hub system since it works with IR, RF and blue tooth. Once everything is set up the Logitech hub app lets you control your system through your smart phone so there's no need to purchase more remotes. By the way, im not an employee of Best Buy, Logitech or Amazon just an electronics freak, but like things simple. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and won't go back to cable TV. One last thing, you still need a broadband connection, faster the better and a good wifi router to set this all up.",pos
"Easy to program and works perfect. I loved it so much, I bought one for my daughter.",pos
The best thing I bought . I kicked My cable provider out and got this. It was he ebay thing I did,pos
Easy to set up and easy to use. The description is exactly what you get. I love this product for all its content.,pos
"The way Amazon has set up their software is pretty great, they make it easy to get connected to your hulu, hbogo, netflix or whatever streaming service you have. Plus if you are a prime member you are already loaded with streaming content straight from the box, I have two Fire tvs and three firesticks, wouldn't change them for anything.",pos
"Wanted too try something different instead of apple, this purchase is amazing, some shows are down loaded in Full 4 k amazing picture. Great purchase",pos
This stick is 100 times better than my Chromecast. Dont know how I had not discovered Fire Sticks versatile functionality before.,pos
I am very happy with my purchase. It is very small which I like because it can fit just about anywhere and does not take up much room,pos
"Fire Tv is the best stream box in the market, it's really easy to setup and if you are a prime member you'll love it",pos
Great response and quick navigation on this device make it a pleasure to use. Software updates frequently keeping your device up to date. Fire tv is extremely user friendly with a nice layout.,pos
"Though I was leary of paying that much for a streaming device, it is well worth the price.",pos
"Works great, but don't like how you have to spell everything out.",pos
"Fast. Almost no buffering. Overall a great product. But only complaint is it's seriously slanted toward Amazon Prime. For instance, I have AMC through a cable subscription. Then why do I need to pay again for episodes on the Amazon AMC app? So stupid. With Roku, I don't need to pay anything extra for episodes I'm already entitled to.",neg
"Owned roku for years. Bought fire tv to root to watch free tv and movies. Only a few apps vs roku. Roku-user friendly more apps.Fire tv- free movies, free recorded tv",pos
Voice feature is really convenient. Fast with little to no buffering. But I don't like that you have to pay for episodes on channels you already pay from Subscribed channels like AMC. Roku doesn't do that.,pos
I hate this product,neg
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done",neg
many problems,neg
Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.,neg

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",pos

Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.,pos
Great product to enhance tvs that are quite as smart as we would like,pos
This thing is pretty awesome. Thank you for the fast shipping,pos
"Used several TV box before, and amazon fire TV's major pros is the root privilege to install app. So far so good. Quickly delivery!",pos
"I bought this product to replace my nvidia sheild. I'm glad that I did. I have noticed that while streaming video that buffering is almost non existent. In my opinion, this is the best platform available for running the Kodi app.",pos
I love it .......................................,pos
"Excellent for streaming entertainment. Easy set up, works great. Compact, sits under TV and blends in.",pos
I recommend this product highly if you want to stop paying high cable /satellite bills.,pos
"After reading scores of reviews on multiple types of units, this Amazon Fire TV was the choice for me. VERY happy with my purchase!",pos
Easy to use. Many options and apps to download. Kodi compatible,pos
I have multiple fire devices in my home. They work great and allow me to access tons of content from 4K down to SD.,pos
Really like all the features. All the apps. You really don't need cable tv anymore.,pos
The best tv box !! Fast and hard. I love amazon thanks,pos
Great product like just as much as the fire stick great,pos
"Great performance, prefer over the fire stick for the larger storage capacity, and processing speed. Also has the ability to be hard wired if wireless signal is too weak. Only drawback is the wires that run to-from the box.",pos
"The Fire Tv is better then the Chrome,Roku and Even the Apple Tv, Yes i said it, Its Better then Apple TV And its Cheaper to! Also KODI ..",pos
This device is awesome! Even better when it's in TurboMode!! Really love the hologram feature...makes everything so life like. Highly recommend purchasing this! Get It!!,pos
"Not a whole lot to say. It does what I wanted it to do and works well with my Prime subscription. Love technology and I also own Apple TV. I prefer Apple products as a whole, but this does well also. If you have Amazon Prime and no preference towards Apple products I prefer the Fire Tv over Roku.",pos
"I love this product. I get to see a bunch of movies, and tv shows.",pos
"fast, easy to use, would recommend to anyone, !!!!",pos
I have the fire stick and now the box. Highly recommend.,pos
We already saved money purchasing this and getting rid of direct tv monthly charges,pos
Love it save money on a fire stick instead of direct tv,pos
"Works as expected, simple setup and works perfect!",pos
"We love being able to watch Netflix using this. We used the ps3 before and that was a hassle. We use the fire tv downstairs where we don't have cable. Some apps cost money, but there are some that you can watch free.",pos
I love the Amaxom fire tv! We watched so many movies and shows during our snow day! I highly recommend this product!,pos
This device has done everything my family has asked if it and easy enough for my kids to not have to teach me how to use it,pos
This is the fastest streaming device on the market. It's as if a mini computer is operating behind my television!!!,pos
Very easy to setup. The navigation through the system is very simple. Great product,pos
"It is hard to beat this box. It is fast, has hardware acceleration for H264 and H265 (up to 4k) video, so it doesn't stutter, even with the highest quality videos. Android based OS easily sideloads apps like Kodi (SPMC) and Firefox browser. The remote is comfortable to use and is actually much easier to use than the current Apple TV (4th gen) remote. Having a microSDHC slot makes up for the dismal 8GB of internal storage. USB slot makes use of a standard wireless keyboard easy. I wish the homepage was more organized/customizeable like the AppleTV, but the apps and hardware itself is every bit as good IMO.",pos
"Switched from AppleTV to Fire TV and absolutely love it. Speedy, lots of capabilities due to Android OS.",pos
Love how I can move my TV to a position I can see from other angles as needed.,pos
The best streamer for the money and for beginners. I love my Amazon box.,pos
Best box. Really like it so far and having 4 k is nice,pos
I use this regularly and have had absolutely no issues so far. It streams seamlessly and the remote with the voice automated speech works great.,pos
Purchased this to use during my travels so that I'm not confined to what is available to me from others. I connect to the hot spot on my phone and I am all set!,pos
Very easy to install. Great way to get the most benefits from amazon prime membership by watching movies and shows. So easy to use my 5 yo can use it!,pos
Best product in the market! I love it and recommended to everyone!,pos
"After visiting my Nephew up in Portland, Or were he introduced the fire stick to me I couldn't wait to get back to Phoenix to purchase one but after talking with the sales clerk I decided to get the Fire TV and enrolled Amazon Prime happy that I did.",pos
Amazon Fire TV is great and works very well. Not disappointed at all.,pos
This works well for those that like movies! I personally appreciate the ease of use.,pos
So easy to move from room to room. We also take it on trips with us. Plug into any HDMI use the hotel internet and boom. All set.,pos
Works well love the 4k a must for anyone who owns a 4K TV east to hookup and use,pos
i have bought both the fire stick and the fire tv. This product is by far the best streaming device available on the market. i would buy more but i dont have anymore tv's.,pos
"Well worth the upgrade. Performance of UI and app has been significantly improved. Voice remote with Alexa is extremely convenient. UI summarizes available content by streaming platform which is extremely helpful. would recommend over other platforms, especially if you are an Amazon Prime customer.",pos
I was so ecstatic to get my fire tv and. It has some really great features on it. Its a must have purchase and i own several. If your a prime member you get free tv from Amazon. Please give it a try it will be worth your money.,pos
Ease of use and setup 9/10It would be nice if it was out of the box easier to view your own content.,pos
Went in for the firetvstick but left with this instead. If you plan on using it a lot and not planning on moving it from device to device this is the way to go. Much faster and also has SD Card inputs. We use it for Kodi and it's much faster than the firetvstick I programmed for others.,pos
"Simple to set up, worth the expense, fully compatible and works fairly well with xfinity comcast.",pos
a great item to be able to stream tv/sports/movies without needing to pay a cable company for their services.,pos
Everything I thought it would be and more. You need Amazon prime to really unlock the potential it has but it's a great buy for a great price!,pos
Easy to use Does a good job of voice recognition,pos
I love my amazon fire tv I take it with me everywhere I travel.,pos
This was purchased to start the journey of ridding myself of ridiculous cable bills.,pos
Was looking for cable tv alternative. This just might be it.,pos
The product fully exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend,pos
Works very good with all my streaming apps and some gaming apps,pos
This is a good product and streams very well for all of our favorite online services!,pos
Very pleased with this purchase. I no longer need cable tv service since I purchased this. Easy to set up. Simple remote control.,pos
Great tv app viewer menus are crisp and the content first rate,pos
"This little box packs quite a powerful punch, stream all your movies and shows, especially great with prime membership. .",pos
"This product has a better processor with 2gb of ram, plus the ports RJ 45, SD Card, and USB, the difference is big for the difference of the price. It's logically faster than the firestick",pos
Love the voice feature and since going to this I have saved tons on cable bills,pos
"I like it, my kids and my wife liked it, 1000 of programs and apps",pos
Enjoying this Streaming Device. I can watch my favorite Movies and Shows on 4K UHD Quality,pos
Pretty much that.. had to connect straight to router so side loading would be faster.. also video quality can drop with wifi.. Ethernet is the way to get every little cent that this device has to offer..,pos
"I have the firestick but once purchasing this firetv, the firestick is now in a spare room and the firetv is my main device downstairs. It's very quick with minimal lagging. If you have a decent IP you will be very satisfied with this product!",pos
It's great only issue is wish the o.s was more open and you could delete more of the things you dont want,pos
Way better than fire stick. I needed more words and had nothing more to say.,pos
"Price was too high( so we found out). Customer service at Best Buy in North Myrtle Beach had very little patience with our questions, not enough questions answered. We later found out that this too is Best Buy policy.",neg
Great Price. Good alternative to downsizing cable package,pos
If you enjoy content from everywhere and have Amazon prime this is worth it !!One word. KODI,pos
"Great alternative to cable with lots of programming and gaming options, allowed me to drop my cable subscription and save money.",pos
"Don't hesitate to purchase. Works great. My son has the Fire Stick which works great, but this Fire TV is so much faster and more responsive. Love it.",pos
"Love this box it's fast, great picture and great with blue tooth pairing.",pos
"Recommend anyone wanting to watch a wide variety of things from movies, TV shows or sports to get one.",pos
I bought a fire stick for a friend and then followed it up with the bigger one for myself. Extremely happy,pos
We bought the Amazon Fire TV device to watch streaming TV and it works great! Love the guide feature!,pos
Good good good good had a lot of shows on it and it is good good good,pos
This is a Very nice option to get to my favorite content. I used audio receiver for simple connection to TV and additional audio options. The push button voice interface works as well as my Echo. As a Prime member content is plentiful and broad enough for my entertainment.,pos
Bought for uhd but not really worth the extra money,pos
I love the easy access to all of the apps especially the Netflix app.,pos

"Bought this to cut the cable cord! Works better than I imagined, highly recommend it!",pos
Great product but every hard to get a hand on one very user friendly,pos
Purchased to use in conjunction with PlayStation VUE. Fire TV offers the guide menu and is recommended by many. So far very Pleased!,pos
Well almost no more cable. We still need the internet but with this fire tv we get to watch all our stuff using our amazon prime account and saved us a couple of hundred a month. Purchased with HD antenna so we still get all our local channels. Highly recommend. There are other things that can be done that can give you more options.,pos
Easy to install and use. Easy set-up. Great for streaming entertainment. Definitely recommend.,pos
Faster than firestick and also has a micro SD slot plus usb.,pos
Replaced an Apple TV with this unit. Far better in speed and flexibilityMore apps and better content,pos
Worth the extra bucks to buy the TV over stick and plug in your Ethernet cable.,pos
This is much faster than the fire stick. Streams clear every time.,pos
This thing is better then the built in apps of my Samsung 4k tv. Its fast and awesome.,pos
Was tired of getting ripped off by Greenlight cable so decided to do something about it.No monthly charge or late fees for movies.,pos
"I bought it for my bedroom, it's great, I use it all the time",pos
If you want to cut the cable cord this the product needed!,pos
This is a great device. Sometimes not as fast as I feel it should be,pos
"Excellent platform for enabling a variety of software applications. Faster processor than the fire stick, which helps against any potential buffering issues.",pos
"Fire TV,is just what it says.I found that this streaming player eliminated any buffering issues I had.I also enjoyed the voice activation feature,and it's accuracy in recognition.Save yourself some time, and just buy it now.",pos
Love it hours of movies ...........................,pos
"Top movies, anytime, just your choice. Old movies!",pos
"Fire tv, for a video geek is wonderful. Now, Hulu, netflix, and amazon prime are all easily accessible from one remote. I like that a lot of the cable channels have apps that you can also get to through the remote.",pos
Iam enjoying my fire tv with all the app and movies would recommend it .,pos
I am an Apple Fan but I had to see what all the buzz was about with the Amazon FireTV. I decided on the box instead of the stick because it had more memory and could be placed in my cabinet. I mainly wanted to use it with Kodi and it has worked well so far. I also like that it supports 4K streams from Netflix. Setup was very easy and was packaged well similar to the way Apple packages their products.,pos
This is an ideal unit to use when cutting the cable from your provider. Very easy to install and there are great YouTube videos to get even more out of the unit.,pos
Great product. No issues. I recommend it for all users,pos
very fast n nice ui but controller quality not great! dropped onced n middle part now rattles but the app controller works great and all apps n games are quick,pos
I have both fire tv and the fire stick. The fire tv is way faster than the stick.,pos
"This is a great device for streaming content to your TV. If you have an Amazon Prime account, definitely a must buy. Worth the extra money over the Fire Stick.",pos
I like the amazon firetv more than the firestick...,pos
"The fire tv was easy to set-up. Neflx, amazon tv, sling, and hulu work great.",pos
Works great. We own two of them and love to watch our shows when/where we want.,pos
It locked up on installing kodi and it wouldn't recover. The device buffers during first setup of any movie. Voice remote is not the best.,neg
Very good value for the money. Quad core processor allows for consistent streaming.,pos
With an Amazon Prime account you have access to a good set of channels. To replace broadcast TV you still need additional service accounts.,pos
"Turned older TV into a smart TV. I wish a hdmi cable would of came with fire stick, as it does the cheaper fire stick.",pos
I have kodi installed and this box works wonders if you don't have one get one,pos
"This little bad boy totally enables us to live our cord cutter dreams. Full of sweet apps that make you think twice about anything you thought you'd miss from real TV. Canceled my cable, onward to the future or bust!",pos
so easy to set up. great App selection. should have purchased this sooner.,pos

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",pos
This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast,pos

Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.,pos
best media player under 100$amazon is the best!!!,pos
"Very user friendly, and easy to set up. I would recommend this to everyone, especially Amazon Prime members as there are more options. Also no lagging time, as I experienced with other streaming devices.",pos
work great sounds good work fast Good 4k tv you can add more thing,pos
Way faster than the fire stick. I hook up to my Garage TV to watch live boxing from the ShowTime app. Plus many more apps. Have Prime subscription but not necessary in my opinion.,pos
Got this for my son so he could use it with Alexa. It's great,pos
Addons loaded very fast and was very impressed with the processor speed. Would buy again.,pos
This fire box has a lot of applications on the box.,pos
Fire TV is a better option than the stick if you are either needing a wired Ethernet connection ( that's the fastest) or installing third party software like Kodi. The extra memory makes the menus much faster than the stick. It's an awesome product.,pos
The box gives you everything Fire TV Stick does and A lot more. Expandable SD storage and USB storage. Both can be used for more apps or your personal videos. Also connect gaming controllers. PS4 controller works great.,pos
I have a couple of these along with a couple of firesticks. Works good with the Kodi App,pos
"Such a great product. Don't pay for cable anymore, that's a waste! I love this thing.",pos
"Have used this device for about 30 days with absolutely no complaints. I was only considering a couple of different units because I mostly use it with Playstation Vue, but we also watch Netflix and Hulu! Alexa is a really nice feature. Completely satisfied!",pos
The Amazon TV box is much better than the stick due to the high quality of resolution that it gives you. You can now have all the apps you need and use thru the Amazon box.,pos
"I bought this to replace a firestick I gave to a family member. Faster, due to its ability to connect via Ethernet to your router. It also has the ability to allow a hard drive to plug into it. A fantastic device!",pos
I have tried all of the Fire TV and I have to say this one is the best especially if you have a 4K TV. I bought this to go with my 4K TV and I have to say it doe snot disappoint. There is a lot of 4K HDR content out there and this is a good place to get a lot of it. I highly recommend getting this version if you are on the lookout for the best.,pos
"Got this for Playstation Vue and realized we love it for all our other TV services too. So easy to search for shows - Alexa finds the shows and gives you all options on how to watch (Netflix, Hulu, HBO GO, Prime, etc.).We use on wifi connection and never have any issues. Super fast and clear for all programs including channels on Playstation Vue.",pos
Has been very good Have watch more movies than I ever have in my life. Has so much stuff on it I haven't seen all of it but find something new on it everyday has so much to explore!!!!!!,pos
Great product I am thoroughly satisfied. Will purchase again if needed.,pos
In my experience the Amazon firestick is by far the best streaming device currently available.,pos
A little faster than the firestick and has 4k. Can only do 4k at 30hz and 4k is not in the menu screens. (Can be a little confusing when thinking the device is entirely 4k when you turn it on and your tv says it's only 1080p and you have 4k enabled on a 4k tv.,pos
This is better then the fire stick much faster streaming less lag,pos
This is one of the best on the market great to watch,pos
I bought this looking to get rid of expensive cable and I love it. I can pick and choose what I want to watch instead of being charged a flat rate.,pos
"Super fast and easy to use. Great device, able to do much more than before.",pos
I bought this for a gift for my nephew and he loved it!!!,pos
great item works real good. awesome awesome awesome,pos
"best bang for the buck out there,works fast, easy on the wallet, just an all around easy to understand and operate product.",pos
This is how to watch TV via streaming using the FIRE TV that's also 4K compatible! LOVE IT-,pos
Has all of the apps you need if you're trying to eliminate cable TV. If it had a YouTube app it would be perfect.,pos
"Does everything I expected, it was very easy to hook up",pos
Easy to scroll through the menu t watch what you want.just less the price of others,pos
"easy to use, has alot if features to entertain urself and ur family",pos
This is my 3rd Fire TV and they all have performed very well.,pos
I like the slick size and the whole voice remote. Now with Alexa you can even control your smart home devices. I upgraded from Fire Stick and the interface needs getting used to.... I like the stick lay out .,pos
Have had nothing but an amazing experience with it,pos
Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that there's no separate profiles yet.,pos
"We ditched cable TV and went to Play Station Vue On a PS4. Two other TV's needed a way to watch Vue. Reviews said the Fire TV would do it, and it does it well. I agree with those who said ""In some ways it does it better."" There is a learning curve on the remote. For example, the upper right button gives you the Programing Guide icon with a quick press. After you have selected a 2nd program, that same button, with a longer press lets you jump back to Last program. Start up is a lot quicker than the PS4. If you also have Amazon Prime, the combination becomes a real bargain",pos
For the price it should come with a hdmi & wireless keyboard.,pos
Works well. Works just like the fire stick but better because you can plug a Ethernet cable for a better connection,pos
The fire box is just what I wanted! It lets me not worry about missing my favorite shows and movies,pos
"i bought two fire tv boxes and both of them have problems, the problem is that the remote suddenly stops working and then it comes back and works, sometimes it takes a few minutes for it to start working. That never happen with the roku",neg
"The image quality is nice, but the speed is much better than the fire stick, increased ram is always a plus.",pos
the sound and pictures are great and easy to download apps.,pos
"Great for anyone who loves, to watch the latest movies, tv shows, and much more!!!!",pos
I would buy this item again. Fast shipping. No hassle.,pos
"Box works great for cutting the cord for cable, specs are great .",pos
I've had the first gen firestick for a while and this is a definite upgrade. Smooth user interface and lightning fast response time. Tons of apps to choose from as well,pos
The Fire TV with quad-core processor is significantly faster than the older dual-core. Makes using streaming a breeze!,pos
"The Amazon Fire TV system was very easy to set up. I was actually surprised at how little the box was, and just how awesome the apps and downloadable games were that you can be use on the Amazon Fire TV. I ordered all my Amazon Fire TV apps online at Amazon and Google Play Store. I am an Amazon Prime and Google Play Store member. I bought this for one reason, and that's Kodi, it's an awesome app for Amazon Fire TV and Fire Stick, and for the sd card reader on Amazon Fire TV it's easy to install and get up and running. The Fire TV doesn't have any issues that I can't fix, and the controls and action and responsiveness to the remote are very smooth. Also the voice control works wonderfully. Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to cut the cable.",pos
I had a fire stick and decided to upgrade this so I can connect my internet straight to it and get higher speeds. It runs fast less buggy and I plan on buying another for upstairs bedroom.,pos
I love these Amazon products! I have so many Amazon products at home I refer everyone gets one,pos
Very happy that I can finally view HDR content on Amazon and Netflix with this. Only gripe I have is navigating thru this software is a little confusing. Not too bad though.,pos
"I can't return through Best Buy, because it's over 15 days. Started out ok, but then it just stopped working. It keeps freezing at home screen and I can't access anything. Extremely disappointed.",neg
Wish I had ordered another one so that I would not have to change it from room to room,pos
This is a great addition to my OTA TV programming. It's the best thing since I left cable TV for broadcast TV!,pos
I am still learning this product as it does not come with instructions/directions and is trial and error process. However I am pleased with what I do know about this product and the performance that I am getting out of it.,pos
I love the new fire tv it works great with all my subscriptions,pos
This product is great and easy to use. It's an all in one entertainment product .,pos
"if you have a fire stick and use it everyday, I recommend upgrading. Actually being connected to my modem is so much faster than using the wifi signal. Less buffering with faster loads. No complaints.",pos
"The Amazon - Fire TV with (2015 Model) work great, easy setup",pos
"Works great. Nice upgrade over the Fire stick as it has an Ethernet port. Heavily focused on Amazon content (duh) but if you have a Prime account, this is a must.",pos
"Did a lot of research before deciding on the Amazon Fire. I actually bought a Roku which had a user friendly interface, but ultimately settled on this device since there seems to be more apps available. Good connectivity and ability to extend memory another plus.",pos
"Very user friendly. Occasionally when I'm switching back and forth between sources, there is no picture, only sound so I have to turn it off and back on. Not sure if the problem is with the fire tv.",pos
Loved the storage space and how fast it stream when watching movies. I haven't had a problem with and of the one I brought. good quality.,pos
"After having to return the stick, the Fire TV works perfectly highly recommended.",pos
"Live where there isn't good cable provider or even satellite provider, Directv here on the coast of Puerto Rico is spotty at best, forget about it when it rains, which is daily in some seasons, the firetv works great with the 4G wireless hotspot I use.",pos

The Amazon TV is great for non Smart TVs. I bought this to be able to replace an old Google Chromecast. This gave me an option to hard wire into my network and utilize it like I did with my old Google Chromecast,pos

This box is fantastic. It is much faster than most of the other ones out there and you can't beat the price.,pos
"IT WORKED AS EXPECTED, WHAT MORE CAN I SAY ABOUT A USB DEVICE",pos
Had the Roku before this and had a big problem with it buffering all the time. This one works much better.,pos
Started with fire sticks as I thought cheaper was better option then I got to see one of these in action. So much faster.. definitely would recommend.,pos
Great box better than the firestick and other boxes,pos
Great for getting movies without adding extras to your cable bil. Very small device.,pos
Very good value for money. You will not be disappointed if you choose the Fire tv.,pos
This gives me so many app and avenues to watch and stream directly.,pos
"I bought a generic one over internet and it sucked so I decided to use this one instead and the performance of this is really awesome, and the Alexa helps a lot to avoid type writing.",pos

Amazon tv is really to use. Recommend product.....,pos
"Although faster than the stick and smart tv apps, it still needs more on stability and better connection for everyday use. Mot worth it if it was more expensive. Still ok.",neg
I purchased one of these to tested it out and wound up purchasing too more,pos
Great to use to make your old TV an smart TV. Enjoy Netflix and all amazon has to offer!!!,pos
It's really fast and has all of the apps that I need,pos
Works well for the intended purpose. Easy to download the app I required for additional viewing.,pos
Better than Fire Stick. Great quality picture. Clarity with ultra hd.,pos
I've been streaming Wi-Fi for a long time this is my 4th device. It is easily the best so far. It is very easy to use and set up and there is a ton of information you can use on You tube. After several ventures on line and down-loads I'm almost reagy to get rid of cable. In a few months I should have saved enough to go to Best Buy and get a new TV.,pos
"Bought this after dropping cable. The Vue is the only subscription (about $35 month) that offered NFL NETWORK, SEC, and ESPN with DVR like capabilities...PlayStation offers a cloud service included. Minor issues with the app. So far it is definitely worth it. I suggest researching which channels PlayStation Vue offers to compare with what you currently watch. You do need a smart tv and high speed internet with a great connection.",pos
"I was tired of the insane cable bills, so I bought the fire tv.........goodbye cable, fire tv meets all my needs",pos
Love fireTVs and Firesticks. They always work well.,pos
Completely satisfied with the Amazon Fire TV. I'll never go back to cable TV again.,pos
This device is excellent picture and sound. Would recommend.,pos
"The fire tv is great for streaming videos from various services. The amount of content available, allowed me to cancel my cable subscription.",pos
Great product! I'm oversees and wanted it for kodi,pos
I used to use an amazon fire tv stick which worked fine. A friend recommended trying the fire tv because it was faster and had the ability to have more storage. Tried it and haven't looked back since.,pos
I already had one of these in my living room where we watch TV most of the time and bought a second one for my theater room....I Love it!,pos
Tons of movies and all the sports you want. No more cable,pos
"Excellent amazon fire stick. Set up was a snap. It is great that you can speak into the mic to search for a title of a movie or show, rather than typing it.",pos
I like the device easy to use. It does the job. I can use a regular keyboard too,pos
Exactly what I wanted. Far faster & better than a Firestick-- the Fire TV rocks.,pos
"I purchased the Fire TV box over the Fire Stick because the box supports 4K video. There isn't a lot out there yet, but I've been able to watch 4k programming from Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm using the Netflix, Hulu and FXNow apps -- Amazon Prime is built in. I also downloaded the free VLC app to stream video from my computer. I may end up getting a second one for another TV. Very happy with the Fire Box.",pos
This item was very easy to hook up and use. There are a variety of free movies to watch.,pos
Just cut the cord and switched to ps Vue along w Netflix and Hulu. Cable bill went from $209 to $91 and I get more now than I did when I had cable. The Amazon Fire tv box is what makes it all possible. Once you break the chains and start streaming you'll never go back and you won't miss a thing. One of the best investments you'll ever make.,pos
Works way better than the fire tv stick. And works well with 4k t.v..,pos
HAD THE AMAZON FIRE TV BOX FOX 1 WEEK AND IT BROKE,neg
Great features. Very smooth operating system. Better than Apple TV in my opinion,pos
"Solid piece of equipment, very reliable and streams great, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",pos
Very pleased with Fire TV. It works as described. Excellent item,pos
This is truly a great product. I would recommend it everybody.,pos
Love the fire stick. So much easier to use than Apple TV. Thinking of getting another for upstairs.,pos
"Bought this to replace a nexus player and happily surprised how much smoother this box is. And Comcast allows more apps to be installed on Amazon firetv devices than androidtv devices for some reason, so definitely a plus.",pos
"Absolutely can't get enough of my fire TV. Best purchase of 2017!! I highly recommend fire TV to anyone who doesn't want to pay a cable bill anymore. Hulu, Netflix, HBO is all u need and at about 1/10 the cost of cable, I love it!! Don't forget Kodi *wink*",pos
Trying Apple TV for the first time. I love it! Can't wait to try out all the apps.,pos
Made my life simple and every app i ever needed is all in one place,pos
Great option for my office to make use of my Amazon Prime membership. Better if it had a browser but the voice option Alexa is wonderful. Search app option is welcomed. I may add the game controller soon.,pos
Very good item can watch thousands of movies and tv shows,pos
"Just make sure you have the proper internet to make it work to it's full potential, but if so, the uses are limitless and you can actually get rid of cable if you do it right!",pos
"Great product, and it moves faster than the firesticks.",pos
I LOVE HOW IT PAYS NO PAUSE MOVIES AND AUDIO LOUD I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS FOR A FRIEND,pos
Works great. Love watching all my shows from a single source now.,pos
Great product. Easy to use. Tons of features. A must for every room (with a tv) in the house.,pos
"I'm so happy to bought it, i will buy two more soon",pos
"I absolutely love the amazon fire tv! I have a 4K ultra HD television as well as Amazon Prime and the picture quality comes in super clear. It's just amazing! I have the firestick as well but the fire tv has better picture quality, especially if you have a 4K tv!",pos
Amazing. Works well. Everything runs quick and smooth and good price.,pos
Had a firestick previously this is far superior. Like this a lot more then the basic new firestick and bestbuy got it to me within 2 days when everyone else was sold out,pos
"I already owned a firestick and needed a second one for another tv, I went in to buy and all they had were the boxes. I picked one up and I'm sure glad I did! The box processes a lot faster than the stick does!",pos
Great every one should have one or two or three will buy another one if was now shopping very easy to use and set up with Alexa helping you thru voice called customer service 10,pos
On the second day the unit disconnected from my wireless network and when attempted to reconnect the remote would not work and I could not click on the network settings button. I return that unit for another Amazon fire and the second unit could not find the remote to pair it. I think I will purchase a google or apple next .,neg

I am happy with this streaming device. Easy to access and provide all the app that I am looking for.,pos
"I have an Apple TV and was skeptical at first to buy the AFTV. However, I am so happy to have switched to the AFTV. So much freedom, yes!",pos
The item works great wish the speeds were faster like the fire box but it still gets the job done just the same.,pos
Firestick was laggy so i upgraded to the fire tv. Smooth and better then the firestick. Should have bought the fire stick instead of the firetv.,pos
Loved my fire box so much I had to get 3! I'll def recommend,pos
"Works great for Vue, and other apps if you don't have a smart TV. Better quality on Vue than my PS4",pos
We have 2 fire sticks and 1 fire TV. This is a great into. Love the voice search remote. NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS APPLE ITUNES.You will not be able to stream Vudu and Apple on this device. Recommended. We are Amazon Prime which I also highly recommend to maximize value for this product.,pos
Cannot beat any amazon product. Especially the firetv box. Way faster,pos
I heard nothing but good things about the fire tv. Although I had to ask around to see if someone could hook it up because it didn't come with instructions but overall I'm extremely happy.,pos
Amazon fire Tv Great product easy to use it's a direct plug-in to your router or Bluetooth,pos
great device. easy to use. smooth. snappy & full of content.,pos
"Use for Amazon Prime video, Netflix, and DIRECTV Now. Would be 5 stars if remote controlled volume and tv power.",pos
I have both Apple TV and amazon fire tv. Love the 4k display and features that amazon fire tv has. The alexa feature is great as well!,pos
Great system gives great Television alternatives for people of all kinds,pos
"Take out the box from packaging, connect box, turn on the box and watch Amazing Amazon tv just like that.....any easier and easier or convenient it can not get. Great buy at Best But.",pos
"I bought this because the PlayStation Vue interface is the same as what you see on Sony PlayStation. But while I was having al sorts of problem with PlayStation running PlayStation Vue, I didn't encounter any of the sameProblems when using FireTV. It's like when Oracle GoldenGate was working better with Sybase database than with Oracle. :-)I will wait for newer version of FireTV for my other TVs.FireTV is the best streaming device for PlayStation Vue.",pos
"Amazon fire tv has faster processor and more memory than firestick which makes the guide and navigation much faster, have sling tv app installed and scrolling through menus etc is really fast. Would recommend this to other people considering amazon firestick to choose this instead.",pos
"The product met my need. Runs very smoothly with an occasional lag but nothing significant, Greatly exceeded previous box I had which constantly lagged and had problems loading. Mind you this box cost doubled the cost of the Amazon box",pos
"We can watch movies and tv shows in 4K, great picture quality.",pos
I would tell everyone ik to get this. U can format it however u like to. Very easy to understand.,pos
Best streaming tool I have seen and used!!!!!!!!!!,pos
"Great system, one of the best android box out there.",pos
"I got this over the Roku Ultra which is 4K compatible, Roku was garbage. The amazon fire tv is a must if you have a Amazon account. Its a great streamer, I have no buffering problems.",pos
"Works awesome...especially the 4K content. This was an upgrade from an original fire tv box, and works better than the old one.",pos
"I also have a firestick but I gave the fire tv a try cause it's supposed to be faster and I can connect an Ethernet cable to it, and it delivered.",pos
If you are up in the air between the two (fire stick and fire TV) go with the TV due to the speed alone.. The memory is also nice but you will have a more enjoyable experience with the fire TV. I have them both in my house but prefer the Fire TV...,pos
I had been using Fire stick which 1080P cabable. When I bought Fire TV then I saw the difference. It can stream 4K content. It comes with plenty of free apps and now I always have many options to watch. Great product.,pos
"I own Apple TV,Google Chromecast, Roku and now a Amazon Fire TV. This is great product for Amazon products. If you are looking for the ultimate media player get the Roku. If you are a heavy Apple fan get a Apple TV, if you use Amazon, buy this.They each have their good and bad. I do not like the Apple TV. I only use it for itunes and mirroring my mac. The Amazon fire is great because you can download android apps. It doesn't have as many tv apps as the Roku, but its pretty easy to add 3rd party apps.",pos
"I have two, one for each TV in the house. I don't even use my Apple TV anymore since I can also play HBO go and Nefflix on Amazon TV and there are several Amazon only shows (sort of like having another Netflix account)",pos
I only use it for display mirroring but it will work for other things that it's intended to do. It works good.,pos
I absolutely love my Amazon box. It's user friendly and affordable. I already have recommended this item to several people.,pos
Highly recommend this box best box I have ever had,pos
I love having all of my streaming videos in one place and log on his single remote!,pos
I use one of these in every room of my house with a TV. No more cable bills and I get to watch what I want when I want.,pos
"Fire TV set up couldn't be easier, gives us access to all out favortie streaming services plus additional apps",pos
I hate this product,neg

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",pos

"We are really loving our Amazon Fire TV. We use it mostly for streaming Netflix because we haven't gotten into any of the Amazon episodes yet. We also use it for watching movies off our Amazon account. The picture quality is great and we haven't had any issues with streaming - no buffering and no freezing has occurred in the 9 months we've had the device. I like the parental control feature that requires you to put in a code before watching something. I'm not completely electronic savvy so I haven't really tried any other features on it yet. I have a Google Chromecast as well and it's my go-to for when we're traveling, but for our TVs at home, I'm very happy we got the FireTV and that it has a remote vs. using our phones or tablets. All in all, a great purchase.",pos
This awesome little device is perfect for everyone. It has an expandable storage which allows you to add personal photos and videos to the Amazon Fire TV box. It's perfect for traveling especially when staying in hotels as you can watch subscribed programming anywhere. I recommend this product to everyone.,pos
Fast response time from unit. Works great. Easy to use. Enjoy watching the device.,pos
Item was plug and play after connecting to wireless router. Add 16g SD card to improve buffering.,pos
I ordered a Roku Premiere+ and decided to go with this instead. Read that Roku owners were having fits with that and the Ultra. Returned the Roku w/o ever opening. it. Good call. This does what I needed.,pos
This device is very responsive and couples very well with an Amazon Membership.,pos
So this thing sucks not many apps work on the amazon fire stick. It is better than the box but still blows chucks.,neg
They came out strong with there best foot forward. Love it and use it daily,pos
Item works well. Best choice for Cord Cutters. Wish I did this earlier...,pos
It's great. I use it every day. Love the voice commands.,pos
I bought it for it's practicality but loved it for its versatility.,pos
This is great for ur tv if an amazon customer. Only thing Alexa needs improvements!!,pos
Super fast compared to the stick. This gets used all the time and saved me money.,pos
"I researched and researched and researched streaming boxes from so many companies, including Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, and other off brands. By far, the Amazon TV was the best option for flexibility and reliability. I currently have three boxes now for each of my TVs and run PlayStation Vue. I have cut my cable bill by almost $70 per month. Plus, I now have the flexibility of other movie apps, Amazon content, and much more. The switch to streaming TV took less than 30 minutes. What a great investment with a very quick return.",pos
I bought this to replace my satellite but have not done it yet. It is laggy at times and has connection issues. The remote looses connection often and doesn't connect back until batteries are removed. A bit hard to navigate with the remote. It works well if all you want is to get Kodi but it is kind off difficult for a newbie. With prime subscription it is great.,pos
We got rid of cable so we bought this. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. I do not miss cable at all!! My husband & I love it!!,pos
"Good product for cutting cable cord and saving money. Faster and more features than Roku or Fire stick, very pleased with product. I originally received a defective remote, Best Buy customer service was excellent in trying to find a new one, even from competitor, they replaced with brand new unit same day I called, even though Best Buy warranty expired 2 weeks earlier.",pos
This was my first time being introduced to the Fire Stick TV and it is awesome with all its features and ability to add multiple applications. 2 thumbs Up!!,pos
Best buy had this product when no one else did. Ok,pos
Better than Fire TV. Some Major tv msnufactures have built un apps where amazon prime can be added n/c.,pos
"Excellent product early and completely customizable can even play video games on it with the acquisition of the controls goodbye cable hello Amazon, oh and 4K also excellent",pos
We purchased this item because our Smart TV has slowed down (Its a few years old) and we were tired of having to use our game consoles and/or phones to stream content. This solved our problem. The Fire TV is very fast and has tons of content.,pos
Easy to find different apps on the Amazon fire box.,pos
I love it it is just awesome all the things you can do,pos
And kodi loads fine. No issues. Had to upgrade Netflix to 4k,pos
Wow - now it comes with the Alexa functions - how do they fit so much into such a small device! - Awesome technology.,pos
"This is probably the most used device in our home besides our phones. We use our fire tv daily, whether we are listening to music. Catching up on our favorite shows, or even watching a movie. I love the voice activated feature, it's nice to check the weather, movies playing at the local theatre, or look up you favorite artists.",pos
I'm so happy I can stream movies from my amazon prime account,pos
"Cut the cord, get rid of cable, and buy one of these. Great device easy to use. No reason to spend hundred plus dollars a month on cable just buy one of these and pay 15 to 20 bucks a month And subscribe to a couple video services",pos
Price was right. Bought it mostly to be able to watch movies but the quality of the movies is not as good as I had hoped which is the main reason behind my average rating.,pos
I am so happy I bought this I have firestick also and love to stream Netflix works amazing and much faster than firestick,pos
"I use this with Kodi, HBO go, directv now, Hulu, prime, and Netflix. Everything runs smooth. I like having the USB port, because I have a controller, wireless keyboard and flash drive that I connect when needed. Can't ask for better.",pos
"This is an excellent device and easy to use. 5 stars if you have Amazon Prime and want to use what's included with Prime. But if you don't have Prime, any Android TV Box would be better at half the cost.",pos
great piece of technology. wish I would have found this sooner.,pos

"Great design, decent remote, 4k support, tons of app support, ethernet support, I love it!",pos
Great overall! Pay the money to upgrade over the stick!much faster!,pos
I've reviewed several units and this is still the best! Easy to install and setup and if you are a prime member it makes it all the better!,pos
"I got this after discontinuing with direct tv. fast internet and playstation vue is half the price and ill i need. box is like an all in one entertainment, easier to watch netflix and hulu on here as well",pos
Best investment ever. No more cable. Glad I decided to get this.,pos
We love the Fire TV! We dropped cable and are using the Fire Tv with several great apps.,pos
Easy to install has everything that I need and more!!!!,pos
"This is my second fireTV that I purchased. It is very user friendly with plenty of apps. I use about 4 on a regular basis and the streaming is fantastic. With the extra ram, little to no buffering.Highly Recommended",pos
Fast delivery from Best Buy as always. The fire stick is awesome. High Quality video great selection. Good Value.,pos
I love how this one lets you download apps. The picture quality is also a 4. I do find myself having to unplug it every 3 days to make it start over or it has trouble downloading. Especially with live tv apps. As for its competitors I'd say this is still the one to get. I find myself having a lot more options with this one. So my cons are minor. But still prevented me from a 5 star rating. I believe their next generation will be a 5 tho. Like I said. It's still the one with the most options available. Especially if you have prime. The best thing about Fire tv is it let's me download the direct tv app so I ditched my cable and just play live tv thru the app. It's the same tv and I pay over a $100 less a month now. It's worth it just for that.,pos
Buy this and load some software and you're set... Watch anything from sports to movies to tv shows...It's great!!!,pos
This was simple to install and allows me to stream all of my favorite programs.,pos
It's the one I was expected. Everything went great this time. Thank you best buy.,pos
Easy to use and very fast. Like the fact that you can expand the memory through a mini sd card.,pos
Great for family time. HD is awesome. Great product,pos
The Fire TV is so simple to operate. My family and I have really enjoyed it. I recommend you buy it.,pos
We love our Amazon Fire TV. It is fast and runs Netflix with no lag or stops. Super happy with it in all aspects.,pos
Got them on every TV in the house. Fast internet is all you need,pos
"So far I only see one flaw that bothers me, no volume control built into the remote, the device is very fast, easy to setup and use, though it does offer prime video stud right up front, but a couple pushes of a button and your on to your Netflix or hulu or what have you, works great with plex as well.",pos
Got this for my 4K Sony. Works great. It's faster than the apps on the tv with more selection. Plus I really like the Alexa voice remote. You can just tell the remote what you want and it goes right to it. Searches all your apps!!,pos
"Great, I can watch anything I want with hd quality",pos
This is my second Amazon Fire TV. This is the newest version and the picture is quite a bit better thatn the first one. Viewing Playstation Vue it works flawlessly at 60 fps. So simple to hook up and use. Amazon had all my apps loaded as soon as I logged in. Love this product!,pos
Upgrades from fire stick. Works good but I really don't see the difference between the stick. I guess a little faster and less buffering,pos
Work as expected Would recommend to a friend good product,pos
Fantastic option for those fed up expensive unnecessary cable and satellite services.,pos
We bought this to have all of our streaming services in one place. It does exactly that. Awesome for logging in and taking it with you.,pos
I'm very happy with my purchase.It arrived on time. Amazing performance.,pos
I have way more buffering with this device than I do with my Apple TV 4 gen. It works just not well. I have a glitch with this unit every time I use it. That indeed takes away from the user experience.,neg
The Amazon fire TV has been a nice addition at home. Has everything you need on one device and more. Highly recommend to anyone who streams videos.,pos
Easy to connect and set up. Provides access to a lot of media. Alexa works great!,pos
Wi-Fi works great lots of options for viewing and works quick. Small so fits behind TV and does not need to be indirect site for remote,pos
I have the Firestick and wanted something for another TV. Went with the Fire TV. This was worth the extra money. Just works so much better. Faster and less buffering.,pos
"Having owned a fire stick, this product is much faster!!",pos
Works as it should. Finally cut the cord! No more cable bills!!!!,pos
The best thing ever. Getting rid of cable was due to this.,pos
Pretty easy to figure out. Lots of different options. So many cool apps!,pos
If you love the Fire Stick you'll love Fire Tv !!!! Fire Tv is a Fire Stick on steroids !!!! Much clearer and loads much faster !!!,pos
"Love this item, faster and better than firestick and other devices",pos
Worked as good as I was hoping. Easy to use and uploads fast,pos
It is Great I Love It Got Rid Of Cable With The Fire Tv .,pos
This is a great way to beat cable. Easy to set up!,pos
Great product!!! Great customer service!!! Can stream almost anything!!!,pos
it works perfectly...4k for 4k tivi and amazon prime,pos
The amazon fire tv stick is awesome. Watch all your streaming videos with no problems.,pos
"After using the Fire Stick for a few months and loving it I decided to give it to my sister and upgrade to the Fire TV for myself. Worth every penny! The Fire TV offers everything the Fire Stick offers but it's so much faster and has more than enough storage anyone would need. The microphone works great. The menu layout is improved and far better than the menu layout on the stick. I have the 4th generation Apple TV and I barely use it Bc the new remote is terrible. The sensitivity pad on the remote is all over the place. The home menu is boring. The only advantage the Apple TV has over the Fire TV is the seamless integration with other Apple devices such as iPhone and my MacBook. Other than that, the Fire TV is far better and I would recommend it over the Apple TV any day.",pos
I like this better than the other devices its a bit pricey,pos
Great product and I would recommend this product for everyone,pos
This is an incredible product that works like a dream. You will want to add this to your TV Entertainment. It's well worth the money.,pos
This is very easy to use. Opened up so many show possibilities.,pos
"Needed something to use because Cable got expensive. This does everything I need in one. No longer have to use the smart features on the TV. Netflix, PlayStation Vue, Plex, Amazon Movies all on one box and it runs quickly.",pos
"I saved $85 per month on my cable bill using the Amazon fire TV. And even though I signed up for Amazon prime, Netflix, and sling TV, I still saved $40 per month and have 10 times as much content and choices. I love it! ( I also recommend using Plex media server to stream all your content directly from your computers to your big screen TV. It's free! )",pos
More poeerfyul than the fire stick same idea just bigger stronger and fastet,pos
These work awesome. Products shipped on time. I would order again.,pos
I'm glad we purchased the TV. We have both and the streaming is better on the TV. Now to upgrade to 4K,pos
Incredibly fast and very affordable. I recommend it to others.,pos
Needed to upgrade from the fire stick as it was too slow and dying from at least a years worth of being used,pos
i love it works great! i bought my son one to he loves it i would recommend IT TO ANYONE!,pos
It's a must buy for the money you can't beat it at all.,pos
"Awesome product, would purchase again! I highly recommend.",pos
Needs to have higher internal memory to be better.,pos
It was an online purchase. I have so far enjoyed my experience and my product.,pos
This is one of the greatest things I've ever bought,pos
Great way to get rid of cable. Easy to setup an de use.,pos

Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.,pos
This fire tv is awesome! Not only is it easy to set up and use but I'm saving a ton of money on cable :),pos
One of the best streaming devices out and at a affordable price,pos
Better processor than the fire stick and has Ethernet port which is always good.,pos
Great does all that I want it too. Will be getting another soon.,pos
Can't wait to make a clean break from cable company.,pos
Perfect for us. We stream a lot and this does the job with minimal interruptions,pos
This is a great product and use and connectivity are simple. Works well with my internet and TV....gives my smart TV an IQ boost..,pos
4k capable .....memory expandable...faster than firestick....perfect...,pos
Works flawlessly. Interface is much faster than the stick.,pos
Easy to work and downloads fast. Very good quality.,pos
Make sure that you get it soon. They sell out fast!,pos
It's a great alternative to cable and satellite tv...,pos
"If you want fast menus and stable streaming, avoid the WIFI only firestick, and get this FireTV. If you want reliable streaming that will not frustrate you, do the work of running an ethernet cable. This box with ethernet is head and shoulders better than a Firestick. Firestick streams well most of the time, but sometimes it struggles and you get errors with either DirecTV Now or PS Vue...forcing a device restart...very frustrating. This box plugged in with an ethernet cable streams perfectly on the same network with the same content 99.9% of the time. I eliminated conflicting frequencies, used 5 Ghz frequencies, have a great router, fast internet, I tried everything. The cure was this device hooked up by ethernet cable. The fact that you can put KODI on this box opens the whole world of movies up to you. You can also load Android apps from your phone to the device with Apps2Fire...I put Blue Iris on my FireTV. If have two of these in my home now, one in the Master Bedroom, and one on my 4K TV. There isn't a ton of 4k content yet, but you can go to Youtube and see some amazing video in 4k there. When I buy a new home at the end of the year I plan to run ethernet cable and have one of these at every television. I cut the cable company off 1 1/2 years ago and have never missed them. Other than internet, I pay $30 a month for PS Vue, and along with KODI I have everything I could possibly want and more. Goodbye Cable TV.",pos
Why pay additional monthly tv sevices from cable company where i can watch movies and tv channels from internet using fire tv.,pos
"The Amazon fire TV is a nice upgrade from the Firestick (although I think the firestick is great for most applications). With the box, you get the added bonus of 4K and hard wired Ethernet connection.",pos
Great improvement in 4k downloads over regular fire stick on Samsung 4k set,pos
I have stopped using my cable box 100%. We watch only a small amount of tv and this does it for us.,pos
I had the firestick before I upgraded to the fire TV and it processes so much faster than the stick. Plus it is pos 4k picture quality.,pos
Easy installation and usage. With the Fire Stick I don't have cable bills any longer.,pos
Easy to use and works great. Able to watch all the things I love.,pos
"I recently cut the cable and is using the Amazon TV to stream NetFlix, Pluto.tv and Plex. Works great. Response time is much better then the Amazon Stick. I have it hard wired to a gigabit port and Plex streaming works well.",pos
"If you're looking to buy a firetv then this is the one. It's faster, better opitions, ethernet port and plenty of storage.",pos
Great value great picture quality fast processor lots of streaming content and games,pos
One of the best purchases I could have made. I don't even have cable at home now because of this,pos
"My 4k tv has an android Amazon app., but it does not include all the features that the box has. The up-scaling of 1080p to 4k is incredible!",pos
"After reading how fast this unit was, I was highly disappointed. My Roku 3 leaves the Amazon Fire Tv in the dust. It takes forever to load up, then freezes several times while being used.",neg
The fire tv has been very easy to setup and use. I haven't missed cable one bit.,pos
Love it and would probably be just okay using the Fire Stick. Don't need all of the extra storage space and the capability of 4K res (Only beneficial if you have a 4K TV).,pos
Easy to set up and use. The remote is sleek and functional,pos
Depending on what your using it for this is the best bang for your buck for online TV!,pos
There are no words except greatest thing created! We use this thing every single day! We watch old and new movies and tv shows!,pos
Fire box is the way to go. Speed rules and this is in the top of the class.,pos
Tryed the stick you wait a long time to receive any movie or show if you get it at all.,pos
I purchased the Fire TV after a few of my friends recommended it. I use it with my projector and the 13' screen picture is excellent. A similar product I was considering was almost $300.,pos
If you have Prime this is the device!! Love it. Get yourself one for sure. No prime maybe not so much,pos
Love it anyday compared to Apple TV.Can program it and add your own apps with ease.,pos
This item is great! It is better than the android boxes online.,pos
Best product ever!!!!! I would buy another and another lol it's great for everything music movies etc,pos
"Works amazingly! Very fast, high quality. I've already recommended to many family and friends.",pos
Bought this to activate playstation vue and have had good luck with it so far.,pos
Have had no problems with the unit. Works as advertised.,pos
"Fast, Reliable, easy to use. Best qUAD Core Processor",pos
"Simple and intuitive. Plays Amazon content, Netflix, and I also run plex from it. Great easy to use product.",pos
These are wonderful items. Easy to use and work. Fast service and saves on my cable bill.,pos
Fast enough to play videos and movies . Also esay to install,pos
Works good. Still has buffering issues. Otherwise no problems.,pos
luv this amazon fire. able to catch shows that I have missed. also able to watch full episodes of series,pos
So happy with this amazon fire tv it's at every tv in this house and those satellite bills in the trash!,pos
This has increased my movie watching. It works so well I purchased a second one.,pos
Amazon fire t.v. is a great media system. Great alternative to the outrageous price of cable t.v.,pos
i really like shopping at best buy in avon indiana,pos
This is a great way to stop paying for cable or satellite TV or at least cut back. If you still want cable without paying for their equipment this item still does not support the twc app but does support fox go sports. That's why it doesn't get 5 stars.,pos
This has worked flawlessly since I bought it a few months ago. Easy to use. Nice apps. Used primarily for Playstation Vue tv.,pos
The Fire TV is everything I could have asked for in an entertainment system,pos
"This is an excellent device for streaming video. The only downfall, it's only wireless so you need a good wireless connection. Other than that, it's totally awesome. I would buy again.",pos
This is a great purchase. It is easy to use. I will definitely recommend it to other people.,pos
This device works like butter. Better than Roku. Tx,pos
Very easy to use and cheap for its price. I would recommend.,pos
"We searched for months, wanting to cut our cable bill. Bought the Amazon Fire TV box. Amazon has their own programming and is adding more all the time. Also, downloaded a bunch of apps, and have been watching TED talks non-stop. Also bought an HD antenna for local channels, of which we get about 45. Deprogrammed the foreign language, shopping, preachers, and still left with about 35 which offer the 5 main broadcasters, and a LOT of 50s-70s repeats.",pos
Was looking for streaming device. Weren't sure if I want to pay $100 for 1 but it was on sale for $70 so decide to buy it. Did research and found it allow me to install dev app to connect to other server source for streaming so bought it instead of roku or apple.,pos
I use this in bedroom. I have the fire stick also. The fire stick didn't work as well in bedroom but this fire tv is great. I like the voice controlled feature as well. Easy to use and set up.,pos
It is easy to operate and happy with Amazon Fire. I wasn't sure how it was going to work but very satisfied of my purchased.,pos
I had a fire stick that I was having issues with connectivity. I didn't really want to spend the extra money but I'm so glad I did this thing is fast and the remote works like a champ,pos
"If the fire stick is great, this is even better. Much faster too. I use Kodi on it an I love it.",pos
I love it! Much better quality than previous version! No lagging at all!!!!,pos
Gives me access to all the streaming apps I use and easy to move from room to room,pos
I got this box on special. This box is faster than amazon fire tv stick and perfect for all of u wanna convert your tv in smart tv. If you have amazon prime you can get more movies and shows,pos
I finally cut the cord since my AT&T Uverse was getting really expensive. It works great with Sling TV and you can easily search through all your apps using the voice search. I should have cut the cord sooner.,pos
I am able to stream movies without any buffering issues and the voice command makes searching for shows very easy.,pos
Cancelled my cable and i saved a lot of money from this..,pos
This is one for the living room. And my other one Is for travel one.,pos
"So I decided to pull the trigger into buying the FireTV, I've use the first version and liked it ok, I've also use the FireStick and don't think it's fast enough. You can get a lot of apps with this box and find it a bit faster than the first version. Pretty good buy in my opinion.",pos
"Before buying the FireTV, I had the FireTV Sticks. In an effort to cancel my cable, I signed up for Playstation Vue. Vue worked on the FireTV Stick and got the job done but when a sale came for the FireTV, I thought why not. Boy, night and day difference in speed of menu transitions and buffering of shows. Everything is just snappier and faster. Going back to a FireTV Stick was so painful because of the lag in menu transitions. If you could afford it, go for the FireTV over the Stick. Also I own a Roku 2 and the FireTV is MUCH more useful because of the ability to sideload apps.",pos
I really like this media streamer it works better than expected.,pos
I use my Amazon fire TV as a replacement for my cable box. I have an Amazon prime membership and I watch their content plus I use the service sling to watch live TV.,pos
"I recently cut the cord to my cable and use the Fire TV as my streaming box for PlayStation Vue it works great easy set up, I just wish it had HDR",pos
Bought to get rid of uverse and installed Playstation Vue. Works great,pos
"I got the FireTV stick more than a year ago. It works fine although streaming video from my NAS sometimesnot very smooth. As I found the NBC Sports app allowed me to watch Olympics on the stick and this FireTV was on sale, I upgraded to this box. The result is a mix. It does stream video better than the stick but the same app did not work on the FireTV as with the stick It keeps giving the authorization error in playing some video clips. Withe same account, I can play the same video clips on FireTv stick or on Android boxes and tablets. I decided to keep it simply because of the great price I paid.",neg
"With Amazon Fire TV, you can access thousands of movies and TV shows instantly. Find favorites quickly or access weather and sports updates using the Alexa voice search...",pos
This is a great product for my home entratainment !!,pos
"This is my second Fire TV box, and it's a great upgrade from the first gen model I had. The buffer time is lightning quick, faster than my Roku. The 4K works well, and the Amazon ecosystem is actually more complete than what the Apple TV offers. Very happy with this purchase.",pos
"Got more than I expected. Got it as a device which replaced my cable box. Subscribed to PS Vue service, works very well. Cut my cable bill from 80 odd to 29. This little device is very snappy. Has much more apps than the Nexus player. With Netflix, Amazon prime movies , Kodi and NBC Sports : that pretty much covers 99% of the content which I would watch.",pos
"If you're already fully committed to the 'Amazon' ecosystem - as in: you have a Prime account, then this is a decent buy. I found it hard to get used to having advertisements in your face, and all the Amazon branding you see everywhere. Aside from those annoyances, the device itself is quite sleek and works fine for Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Video streaming. Playing files directly from a USB drive or MicsoSD card was a bit clunky but still do-able. An active internet connection is required to use most features of the device.",neg
easy to use and navigate. controller is not complicated.,pos
"I had the original fire stick and I don't truly see that great of a difference between the new and older version. I was hoping that whe. The new version came out I could really understand and justify why I was paying more for a new one, when my old one worked just fine. Unfortunately, I can't. For me, it's not worth the money and I returned the item and stuck with my other one.",neg
This toy is easy to setup and the 4k feature compliments my 4k tv. The dedicated amazon fire tv works better than amazon in my smart tv.,pos
Its very user friendly for someone not good with computer at all.,pos
Awesome product!! I buy them regularly!!! If looking for a good device buy this one,pos
I can now watch all my favorite shows with Hulu and Netflix as well as all movies available with my Amazone Prime membership....,pos
"We're streaming 4K content from our app, and we wanted to test the quality of streaming. Fire TV worked great streaming 4K!",pos
I hate this product,neg
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done",neg
many problems,neg
Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.,neg

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",pos

Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.,pos
Great device. This could seriously make me ditch any cable service.,pos
"I love this device. I have an Amazon prime membership, Netflix and SlingTV and this allows me to utilize all three easily.",pos
This is my second Fire TV and the setup is as easy as the first. Very simple to use and the benefits pay for itself. Worth it.,pos
Definitely the best buy for your buck. I have too of them both hard wired and no buffering ever. Love my Fire TV's.,pos
I would recommend this streaming box. This is one of those things that everyone should own.,pos
Easy to install and use! Love it. I am tired of being gouged by cable.,pos
"Great all around product. Sleek and does its job, since purchased I haven't looked back",pos
"If you don't want to pay the extra for the smart tv, add a Amazon Fire Tv, to your tv and you will have a Smart tv. Great for the price.",pos
"Dear readers, if you have a 4K tv and want to purchase a device that can provide prodigious streaming entertainment quality then purchase this device now!!! It also has double the cpu speed (quad-cord) and GPU performance than the cheaper Amazon Fire Tv Stick model. However, if you don't have a 4K tv, then I advise you do not get this device, because you won't be getting your whole money's worth.",pos
All the best that the last Fire Tv was but now it's 4K ready and you have Alexa to help guide and open apps. My mom loved her gift.,pos
Can't be beatPrice and product great valueHighly recommend,pos
This Fire TV meets all requirements. I haven't turn on the Apple TV since I purchased this device.,pos
Easy to navigate! Easy to understand how to load apps!,pos
"Worth every penny, if you set it up correctly.....",pos
Everyone should get this and eliminate cable!!!!!!,pos
"Best streaming device out there, very fast and responsive. A bit more than fire stick but very well worth it!",pos
Hard to say anything wrong about this product. Works great.,pos
Use it mainly when I'm not on my Apple TV . The Amazon fire tv is much better than the fire stick because it doesn't heat up .,pos
"I found this product let me let go of cable tv and saved me tons of money, since I am on limited income i had to let cable go I kept my High speed internet and use my Fire to watch movies and save Tons of money.",pos
We went from a Roku 1 to this and are very pleased. Not fair to compare the two as the Roku 1 is old tech. You would have to compare it to the Roku 4. This streams very smoothly. Look and feel are great. So is voice search for Amazon Prime content.,pos
Fire TV is the best way to cut the cord with the cable company. We have Fire sticks already but the TV is much better.,pos
I recommend this and the Apple TV. They are both great products. I like the voice remote. Plus if you have Amazon prime. You can you Prime tv.,pos
"We needed something easy to use for our bedroom tv watching. It was easy to set up and with our wired connection, it functions very quickly and is easy to navigate with the simple remote.",pos
"this amazone fire tv is so awesome, you can download the apps called UVERSE yes if your cable is UVERSE u can play it with this app you can bring it to your neigbor or somewhere else..",pos
"This Fire TV does everything that I need it to and more. It's stable and never have any issues. Ever since I got it, I use it daily.",pos
the console is small so you can basically place it anywhere. Very fast recommend to everyone,pos
"I've bought Fire TV originally for my second TV which is not a smart tv. Shows start playback instantly, voice search is the easiest thing to use. My only complaint is that voice search does not work in 3rd party apps yet.",pos
It was good. It was good.It was good.It was good.It was good.It was good.It was good.It was good.,pos
"The Fire TV box definitely connects faster when using for streaming well worth the money at Best Buy.com definitely recommend it. No buffering, Stable!",pos
This is a great product but I wish we could get local tv,pos
This box has a ton of apps and features on it as it comes... and it gets even better once you install KODI!,pos
I bought this router because I needed better signal to my second floor of the house. This does the job with no issues. I would recommend this router.,pos
I love the fact that I can expand the memory. The image is much better and faster than the stick,pos
I am enjoying my Amazon Firestick TV. The best investment I've made.,pos
"This is the best cord cutter streaming box on the market. I've owned Roku, Apple TV, and Chromecast and this is by far the best. Offers great performance, the remote is very user friendly and I think it has a better selection of apps. The interface is laid out nicely but feels a little compact with a lot of stuff on the screen all at once.",pos
"Overall I find to be better than cable. Better line-up of channels to choose from, and no outrageous bill.",pos
Purchased this along with the fire stick and the fire tv works way better,pos
Bought a fire TV player to replace an aging PS3. Works as advertised. Alexia can be a little quirky at times however.,pos
I have a FireTV in every room because the processor speed is the fastest and it requires little buffering time. I highly recommend this unit.,pos
"The Amazon Fire TV product is great, highly recommend it to anyone. Best Buy's service on the sale was not. I ordered the item online for an in store pick up the next day. Went to pick it up and they said it was scheduled for delivery to a home address in 10-15 days. Although they had plenty in stock, Their only option was to cancel the order and redo the sale. While this may not seem like a big deal it was not how I wanted the purchase processed, since I was getting bonus miles with a specific credit card.",pos
"The product is easy to understand and use. If you have already viewed a series from Plex, Hulu, or another provider, the remote will take you to where you left off. If you want to view something from Amazon Prime you press the button and speak the name and it finds it for you.",pos
"Amazon Fire TV has been a great device and is a big improvement over the Amazon Firestick. With Fire TV, there is no lag in apps and runs smoothly and without delay. The biggest reason we purchased this was to begin using PlaystationVUE and it has worked flawlessly.",pos
This is a great product. My only problem is that it got to hot and had to return it.,pos
By far the best streaming device in the market. I have one for every room in my house.,pos
"the amazon Fire tv is amazing, it never buffers when I'm watching movies or tv shows in 1080p. I have referred this to friends and they have purchased this item.",pos
"Works as expected upon purchase., no issues easy setup.",pos
Great product if you are already a heavy Amazon user. Bought one for my parents and they love how they can stream free movies from Prime.,pos
Amazon Fire TV is the best box for watching whatever is available. Easy to set up and up to 4k viewing is available.,pos
". Works great. Super fast loading opposed to the firestick and rokus. I love it, one of the best quad processor TV boxes out there.",pos
I love the fire sticks and this is definitely the top dog. Very fast.,pos
"excellent device, very fast especially when connected to ethernet",pos
"Simple, easy to set up and an all around great product",pos
I bought the fire TV to use with Playstation Vue It is more responsive for Vue than the app on PS4,pos
good product for a best price! highly recommended! 4K supported!,pos
The fire tv has exceeded my expectations. I use it all the time. The increased specs make it hands down worth the extra investment over the fire stick.,pos
"I bought that for my parents. Great product, easy to operate, they love it. Also great price, thank you, Best buy.",pos
I have cut my cable. I would have done this before but didn't know how to get college sports. Fire with Amazon and SlingTV has bridged the gap. I receive local channels with an antennae and the fire does the rest. Saving about $75 per month.,pos
"Works well; however, sometimes doesn't connect requiring user to unplug and re-plug to get connection. Needs a simpler way to store home videos. Background sound and music weakens dialog sound requiring subtitles.",pos
"I love the Fire TV concept. I had the Roku before and didn't like it so that went back to the store. I've played with the Fire TV for a couple of days and fell in love with it. All my Amazon contents are on here.I'm trying to cut my cable tv provider out and I think I found a good solution. When my FIOS contract end, I'm moving over to the Fire TV and I'll just get a HD antenna for the house. This unit is very fast and very capable. Based on the Android environment, you can do almost anything on here (entertainment wise.)",pos
"It is faster than amazon fire tv 1st. it was so easy to connect and work! Plus I have the 4k TV and it's a 4k system. You can watch some tvs, movies and some 4k contents for free if you are a amazon prime member, $99 plus tax for a year.",pos
I like the fire tv because it's easy to use and I can get all my services in one box. I also like the voice control feature and the included games. The thing I dont like is that sometimes the cache gets full and the stream starts to cuts even with my 100M conection. A faster dual or quad core procesor with more memory would be great.,pos
I watch everything on this now From movies to Sports and ur everyday news,pos
"Top notch streaming box, especially if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber. I like the voice search but wish it extended to other applications like Netflix.",pos
I simply love my Fire TV. It is fast and has tons of free content with prime. The only complaint I have is that there is not one app that will link to my Ultraviolet library,pos
i have this and 2 fire sticks and a alexa. combine that with amazon prime and you have all you need,pos
Quick streaming and 4k capable make this device perfect.,pos
Very nice streamer! This is my second Fire TV so I like the product... On some apps the UI is way better then the Roku's. Highly recommended ... but also have 2 Rokus.,pos
"I have both the fire stick and the fire tv, the fire tv is much faster considering the processing power.",pos
I bought the Fire TV to watch Playstation Vue. It has a good app for that. I like the setup and the ability to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime videos.,pos
This product is much better than the fire stick I wish it came with a HDMI cable though,pos
"Never had a streaming device, but so glad I got this. Helped me cut the cord and will not look back.",pos
"Very nice product, works seamlessly. Very easy to setup. easy to down load apps and has a faster processor. You can down load the movies/songs and other stuff if you connect the hard drive. Voice activated remote is an added benefit.",pos
I purchased this after owning the Amazon Fire Stick. The Fire TV is faster and has expandable memory. We have since cancelled our satellite TV and rely on the Fire TV for our entertainment. Easy set up and perfect for Amazon Prime members.,pos
"Easy set up, easy to use! Highly recommend to anyone!",pos
This is one of the most powerful streaming device in market. Kodi runs super smooth on this and not to mention the great features that come along with Amazon prime membership,pos
"my husband loves this. we coupled it with the playstation vue streaming service for $30/mo and dropped cox cable totally. we found that the amazon fire box offers a channel guide for ps vue that the roku does not, which is def a helpful feature to have with ps vue.",pos
We canceled cable and love our firebox. It saves us about $200 a month.,pos
"I just got this a few days ago, and very impressed with how lightweight it is! The device has taken all the best things and compacted it into a stick that take up minimal space.",pos
I have really enjoy my amazon fire tv. It has so many great apps and more.,pos
This is so great! Love it and looking forward to ditching my cable company!!,pos

This was easy to install and is very easy to use. No complaints at all!,pos
Being an Amazon Prime member this little box made a great addition.,pos
"We had the Amazon FireTV stick but it was VERY slow and tended to freeze up now and then in the middle of high-definition movies. So, I asked the Best Buy sales person if I would see an improvement with the FireTV box, and he said yes. Sure enough, he was correct. It is SO much better. We are enjoying this product much better than the stick version. It's worth spending the extra money.",pos
Work great with a 4K TV. Better quality than my other streaming devices,neg
"I love this device. Small footprint, but tons of options.",pos
"I love my Amazon fire t.v. So awesome had to get another for my bedroom t.v., Best Buy, best service!",pos
"I use this and my Apple TV, the amazon fire box is great you can watch your favorite shows through them and Hulu and Netflix, what makes the fire stand out is that you can add apps you can't find in their App Store, kodi makes cutting the cord so easy!",pos
A great alternative to cable/satellite. Not as expensive as Apple TV but just as much content. Got it on sale at a great price.,pos
"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV to cut my cable and use it for Play Station Vue. It has worked great. It is super fast compared to the fire stick. I tried the Roku as well but for this application the Fire tv was the clear winner. I liked it so much I bought 3. One for all my Tvs. The Roku didn't have a guide menu and that was a big issue. It also works great with Netflixs. Picture quality is great, probably better than what I was getting with cable. Overall this is going to save me a lot of money and I am not missing any quality or channels.",pos
"It works great. I had a an Amazon Fire Stick previously. The Amazon Fire TV responds quicker and I have not had any buffering issues, thanks to a faster network interface card.",pos
"Use this to stream Netflix, hulu, sling TV, and now Vue tv. Ended up canceling sling TV bc Vue tv is better and more channels for less.",pos
"If you want to start using Kodi and don't want to spend $200+ on a Nvidia Shield and don't want the laggy performance of a Fire Stick, spend your money on the Fire TV BOX. Runs amazing!!!",pos
"havent been able to use to its full potential, but cant wait",pos
I uses these for Kodi and they never let me down. Hate seeing people pay more for items that don't need it. If you interested in difference between fire tv and fire stick the TV is boat loads faster than the stick. I started with 2 sticks and now have 2 TV's,pos
"Good box, but menu slow when booting up and control loses sync at times.",pos
"A good friend of mine got into transforming Fire Sticks and Fire TV two Kodi boxes. He brought over his Fire TV and led us use it and afterwards my wife was convinced that we needed to have one. With Fire TV it makes Kodi stream smoothly and the menus are quick. I love that I can have Netflix, other apps, and other programs installed all on one unit.",pos
Easy to connect and use!Greats apps Great product Get it!,pos
I am glad to have made this purchase. I am pleased with the Amazon stick,pos
It's pretty fast response time on switching between apps and pretty good 4k visual also.,pos
If you have prime and Netflix this is what you need. Voice search is great on prime.,pos
"I travel a lot and stay at different hotels...it works perfect for this. It allows me to sign-in to the hotel Internet page for the verification, without having to get it added to the hotel via the Internet administrator. I get all the applications I need and even added those extra that make it more personalized. Great product and the price was just right.",pos
Works great. Very responsive compared to the Fire stick,pos
Great device really like the option to use either wifi or lan,pos
"wanted to bring computer life to big screen. don't have smart tv, so this was perfect",pos
we love our amazon firetv box it does so much for such a nice price,pos
I have three amazon products this as well as a kindle and fire stick. This fire TV has the advantage because of the ethernet port. Offers Fox Go for the Yankees but still no TWC compatibility which is why it gets 4 stars out of 5.,pos
Easy to setup and use and now with voice search. I recommend it with even 4K content. Best Buy had it on sale as well.,pos
This Amazon Fire TV box works as advertised. It was a breeze to set up and took me about five minutes to figure out how to use the features and functions.,pos
"Very happy with the Fire Tv box. I use it to watch live tv on the Playstation Vue app and the picture clarity is great. It freezes up sometimes, I'm not sure if thats a problem with my wifi connectivity, the fire tv, or the app.",pos
Product works as expected. Easy to set up and easy to use. Love it,pos
I hate this product,neg

Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.,neg

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",pos

Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.,pos
We have a lot of technology in our house. This is one great way to streamline and simplify the systems.,pos
"This device is easy to use, and with internet and selected video apps, there's no reason to leave the house!",pos
"I do like the Amazon TV idea. I do miss my DVR. I also miss all of the LIVE TV abilities though. Until Amazon TV gets LIVE TV abilities, this only gets 3 stars. Works well. Easy connect. But there are alot of reasons to miss Cable tv!! The channel selection needs to improve!",pos
"Wish I would of purchased sooner , one of best item",pos
"We already had a 1st generation in the media room and a FireTV stick in the bedroom. We have the stick to my sister-in-law (which she loves) and moved the old FireTV to the bedroom and the new model to the media room. We use it for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Plex. All of which seem to run a little faster and handle .mkv and .mp4 videos much better.",pos
"I'm pretty happy with this, just takes a little bit of time to figure out were everything is at.",pos
"Faster than the stick. Overall it is great. 4 stars due to occasional buffering or errors. My internet speed is fast enough, so it isn't clear if internet or box is issue. I use with PlayStation vue and I am happy with it and cancelling cable!",pos
I'm happy with the purchase. Had to buy additional memory but satisfied.,pos
"Recently purchased this amazon fire box. I am still learning how to work everything. I am enjoying it so far. You do have to have a Netflix account and alot of the other applications to use alot of things. However, their is a work around for everything lol. I will possibly invest in more of these down the line and maybe get my family to finally cut the cord also.",pos
"We bought this Amazon Fire TV to use for our Sony PlayStation Vue package as part of our cord-cutting plan. We are also Amazon Prime members so it made sense for that application also. The picture is great on our Samsung 65"" 4K tv. The only drawback so far (why I only gave it 4 stars) is that our Logitech Harmony 650 remote will not operate it, thereby forcing us to keep track of the remote.",pos
"Great product, I have Apple TV 3, and this is just as good or better.",pos
I wish i had known about this product sooner works great.,pos
Great streaming device and it's a bit faster than the fire stick. Great buy.,pos
Way faster then the stick. And better quality. Worth the extra money. Especially for kodi,pos
I have both Fire tv and the Fire Stick. The Fire TV can connect via cable to internet andcis definitely faster than the Stick. Also had more storage. If you don't need to connect wirelessly and don't mind the extra $$ get the Fire TV,pos
amazon fire tv is on fire... this is the best stream device now in day.i will highly recommended. the speed is amazing. all you need is a good internet service to enjoy it's maximum potential.and if you have a prime account in amazon you get to enjoy many movies and tv series. get this device for your home,pos
Saved money on cable. Can watch a lot of current movies.,pos
"Took a while to get one since all stores were out of stock. Ended up ordering online and getting free shipping. Has all apps plus HBO Now which is great. So far, so good!",pos
This was easy to set up and use. It is an excellent product for Amazon Prime members. We have cancelled our satellite subscription since purchasing the Amazon Fire TV.,pos
I purchased this box as a replacement for my Roku 2 box and it is awesome. Can do all the things that Roku cannot do. Best decision ever made in terms of my electronics.,pos
Great item. You get so much from such a small box. It's definitely worth the money.,pos
It was an excellent purchase from best buy. I would recommend buying this if you Netflix.,pos
"I purchased the firestick first and had it for awhile and really enjoyed it until i decided to spend the extra money to get the box for my second one and i could not believe the speed difference in the two, the box is awesome i love it!!!",pos
"Amazon does it again. Worth every penny spent. Watch all movies, shows. I'm gonna purchase more!",pos
Works flawlessly once a strong wifi signal is established and love the ability to add Acorn TV (British productions),pos
I went into store to inquire on differences between Apple TV models. Sales person answered my questions but also suggested I consider FireStick. educate yourself before purchasing.,pos
"Super easy to setup, I would even say you can cut cable tv if you put kodi on it. I have several thought the house and it never seems to be slow.",pos
Way better than the firesticks. I would definitely recommend this item,pos
"The product works very well, but the user interface is too busy and not really tunable. It is also difficult to search for new apps that aren't already listed. Voice control works okay, but Alexa remains a far cry from Siri.",pos
Setup was very simple. I can actually hide it behind TV and still use remote. I was surprised how fast it boots up. Makes my TV a smart TV that allows many more apps than the ones that come built in generally.,pos

A must have gor streaming apps. Kodi app is ok too if you get it going. Take it when traveling. Works fine as long as yoi have decent wifi,pos
The Amazon fire TV device is incredibly fast very cost-effective and super reliable. Great for gaming movies television and a lot more. I love it! Buy it now.,pos
i love these thing buy them for my friends all the time,pos
"PROS: - A MUST for Amazon Prime subscribers - lots of media content - For PlayStation Vue subscribers, it's speedy and fast; works great- Noticeably faster than 1st generation Amazon Fire Stick- High-quality feel of the remote control- Smartphone App works great- Alexa-enabled CONS:- Vudu app is not supported by Amazon- Not compatible with generic universal remotes (unless you buy Logitech Harmony Remotes) TIP:- Prices can easily fluctuate from $79-$99",pos
"Great media player for watching movies and shows from netflix,hulu, etc. easy to navigate, quick quad core cpu keeps things from lagging, and voice commands via the voice remote make this a winner.",pos
Better than the stick. Doesn't overheat and supports 4k,pos
"A bit dissapointed in local station reception. Fire tv is not what was expected. OK, but just not as expected.",neg
I love this!! I have the Apple TV also but find the amazon fire tv easier to navigate,pos
We love this fire tv as it has everything we need to watch movies and shows as well as fast streaming,pos
"Perfect for anyone who loves to watch any type of movie, always available at anytime,,,,",pos
much better than the stick...do not i repeat do not waste your time or money on the stick...go directly to the fire tv,pos
works a lot better than the fire stick. love that there is an sd card slot.,pos
This product allows is to stream almost all tv shows and movies made. We are able to look at old as well as new shows.,pos
I don't really see a difference between the box and the stick. They both buffer. I do like that I expand the memory on the box.,pos
Best purchase I made this year. I got the Amazon TV box for the TV in the kitchen. I took the cable box back to the cable company. No more boxes I am savings money. The Amazon TV box have a faster download and the picture is clearer. I can watch my Netflix on the Amazon TV box and other lmovies and tv program. I going to purchase another box for my family room.,pos
Does what it said on the fire tv. Not a bad Device.,pos
It has been a great streaming device. Its very reliable.,pos
I just prefer live TV. When you purchase these don't forget to buy an antenna so you can watch network TV and local news.,neg
"i think amazon fire tv has more to offer than apple tv. really good, easy to use",pos
Much better than any other streaming device and it has many options and allows you to be wireless or direct through Ethernet. I have it setup so I can watch many of the movies and shows I like. Glad I went with this!,pos
"Wish the Amazon fire had more connections, i.e. Optical option.",pos
The Amazon Fire TV Box with 4K streaming works very well.,pos
Of course some of the shows don't come in the greatest sometimes but love this product and the best is I am saving money from not bothering with the cable companies and having a huge bill or the next month wondering why the cable bill went up in price.,pos
Awesome media device. Great option for those looking to get rid of cable.,pos
I've had the Amazon Fire TV for a few weeks now an absolutely love it. My wife and I have cut the cords with cable tv and now stream everything through Fire TV. The quad core processor can keep up with the most demanding HD streams and 3D movies without buffering. If needed Fire TV can be hardwired to you router for additional speed. The apps are endless and you can run all of the popular options out there including Hulu and Sling. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking to escape cable.,pos
"I bought this item and have not been able to put the remote down. A great product that I would recommend for anyone, works well with my 4K TV",pos
"My new Amazon Fire TV works terrific! Great for streaming TV service, PlayStation Vue.",pos
Bought this for my father and he loves it easy to use,pos
This product is great. Very fast and responsive and allows you to cutomize however you feel.,pos
"Bought so I could cut my cable. So far, so good. Easy to use.",pos
"maybe i got a dud, but from every forum i read it seemed the fire tv box was 10x better then the stick. although it is faster, i still have a lagging experience with this streaming device",neg
"I owned a Fire Stick previously, but when I bought a 4K TV, I wanted a media streamer that could playback 4K content. I tried the Roku but ultimately returned it for the Fire TV because it allows CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) over HDMI, which the Roku did not. For those who don't know, CEC (found in most new TV sets) allows your remote that comes with the TV to control other devices connected through an HDMI cable. Now I only need one remote for everything and didn't have to go out and purchase an expensive universal remote. The Fire TV was exactly what I needed for my 4K setup and now I use my Fire Stick for travel. Great product and great service from Best Buy.",pos
"This product is well made, durable and reliable. I have had good experiences with this manufacturer. I recommend this manufacturer and this particular product. This product does exactly what I need it to do. Super easy to use. I have used other manufacturers in the past but have not always been satisfied. I am happy with this product.",pos
Decided to go with this along with playstation vue and a couple other subscriptions I already had to cut the cord from cable. This little box is excellent for all sorts of streaming. Shows come in very clear. The response time is great. Only down side is bluetooth and not IR but a nice $20 adapter and boom now my universal remote works with this. Definitely would recommend for anyone looking to cut ties with their cable company.,pos
Bought this on a flash sale 64.99!! This is great especially when running the playstation vue app streaming!,pos
"Fire TV is a game changer, definitely worth it to spend the extra clams on this over the fire stick. Awesome product,",pos
Fire tv works great no issues long as your internet is working good you will forget you are streaming,pos
A great product for cord cutters!!! Works like a charm.,pos
I have watched about 15 to 20 movies and haven't experience any buffering or freeze,pos
We bought this to stream TV so we could cut our cable bill. Streaming live TV with Playstaion Vue and watching movies through Amazon Prime has worked well. We also have the less expensive Fire Stick and this product works much better.,pos
I like this much better than the fire stick. Great for Alexa!,pos
"Makes Dumb TV Smart, very small package. Slides under flat screen TV, remote works everywhere, no lost signal. Fire works better wireless...weird...Voice control is a nice feature, but the remote gets me there faster.",pos
"I have the Amazon stick but this is much faster and better. I am very happy I purchase the Amazon TV box. I bought this TV box for my bedroom which I spend 90% of my time. It is much faster than my regular Netflix site. I love the idea I can also log on to my Netflix on the TV box, too. I am going to get another one for my family room. Good thing it was on the Labor Day sale (Smile)",pos
"I think it is a great product, although I could not say whether Fire TV is better than Apple TV. Fire TV is better with the Amazon movies and shows, while Apple TV is directly through the iTune store for movies and shows.",pos
"This is the best streaming box for the money, it does favor amazon content.",pos
"I have owned a few more similar products including the fire stick. The stick works on but the TV work great! Zero lag, runs like a top, streams perfectly! Its the perfect start for getting rid of your cable bill.",pos
I've use the Amazon fire tv and the Roku. The Amazon fire box In my opinion is easier to use and I prefer the Amazon remote over the Roku. The only problem I've had with Amazon fire would be the life of the batteries in the remote.,pos
"It works very well out of the box. Most of the apps you want will be there. The remote works flawlessly and is blue tooth so you don't have to point it at the box. Amazon locks down android, so you are missing some apps, but all of your streaming apps will be here. Expanded memory is nice as well. Great beginner device.",pos
Setup is extremely easy. Access to numerous movies and apps. Streaming works great. Perfect option for people who want to stop paying for cable. Ensure the software is updated after first setting up your Amazon account. Few Cons: Only able to use the voice search option on the main screen.Must reboot occasionally if WiFi connection fails.,pos
"This device is much slower than other similar devices on the market. The internet connection is not stable, even when direct in via Ethernet.",neg
"Runs much better than the fire stick, especially for some apps such as Playstation Vue. The fire stick is more convenient and takes less room but is not as powerful. If you are buying the product for Playstation Due then you will be returning the Fire Stick to buy this one.",pos
"I liked the first one so much, I went out and bought another one! Love everything about this product. Please ensure you have great internet in order to properly run the services.",pos
"PROS:1) What an ultra HD clarity. It is just awesome..2) Very easy interaction to navigate.3) Earlier I have used ROKU but after AMAZON FIRE TV stands miles ahead of ROKU in many positive ways.CONS:1) You can't use voice remote in many apps. Very few options to use voice search.2) Wifi signal receiver is very poor. Initially I used this on WI-FI and at that time it will keep on buffering and clarity was very poor. I contacted with AMAZON and raised as defect and got new one. Again same issue happened then I used it over ETHERNET port and then I realized the problem is with the WI-FI receiving capacity of this device. I placed my laptop near to my AMAZON device and took speed test it showed 25MBPS, even then clarity was very poor over WI-FI.Hence I would recommend to use this over ETHERNET connection.",pos
"Great device. Very fast and responsive. Capable of streaming in 4k and while there is limited content, it comes thru beautifully. Alexa and voice search is fantastic.",pos
"Still learning how to use all the features. Searching is a breeze. Can search by many options. Have used it by actor, movie title, or show title. It will bring back what is available and sometimes advises of other sources (ie. Netflix). The voice search feature is a homerun! No more typing in the name without a keyboard!",pos
"Great hardware. I owned the Fire Stick before getting this. It's WELL worth the extra money. Loads WAY faster and much less buffering. I love Amazon Prime. Wish there was better/newer/more frequent movies but for being included with all the other Prime services, it's a deal. And the Fire TV is the perfect way to access it.",pos
"One of the best media boxes I've used. Heavily Amazon based, but works awesome and also has an Ethernet port that makes streaming fast!",pos
Very easy to navigate and so many option it's unbelievable. This great gadget saving me alot of money canceled my cable subscription.,pos
This unit is great. It has everything that I need in it plus more. It's fast and responsive with great voice recognition. The UHD content is awesome.,pos
Fire tv is great!!! Easy to use!!!! I love that you can speak to give it commands,pos
"Got this while on sale & used Best Buy points ! Got it for super cheap . Being a Prime member makes this worth while. So far the Fire TV has performed flawlessly. There are many apps to choose from, some not available on my Apple TV . This box is 4K ready with some Prime eligible titles to stream . The interface is not quite as nice as Apple TV but works ok . I would say it is worth what I paid and then some !",pos
"The box is fast, does what was advertised. Quick and easy to connect. Alexa and the voice activated remote is a really nice feature.",pos
I was tired of my cable bill being so high so I got the amazon Fire TV + Digital antenna. This is a great alternative to Cable TV.,pos
"The Fire TV from Amazon works great! I have cancelled cable TV and am watching movies, news, football and etc. via Sling and the Fire TV. Takes some getting used to, but I would highly recommend if you want to save money on your cable bill and still enjoy TV.",pos
Bought this to use in my basement after I decided to cut the cord. This item works awesome and is exactly what I needed. The main reason I purchased it was to stream PS Vue but there are many other devices that do that now. Not at all disappointed with this item.,pos
Had the firetv stick and wanted something a little more powerful that also had the capability of playing 4k content. Much smoother experience overall with the firetv.,pos
This product blows ROKU out of the water! I would definitely recommend this to my friends!,pos
Easy to set up. So far I like it. I added CBS All Acess to it and work great.,pos
"We no longer have Directv or anything else. Chose this to have something else to watch on TV. If you are a Prime member with Amazon there are tons of shows, movies, games, etc. to watch/use.",pos
Looking for ways to save on cable. Still required cable account to access many of the apps.,pos
"Small enough to make it portable, a lot faster then the Stick.",pos
I was surprised at every thing this little fire stick could do!,pos
Luv watching movies on the Amazon prime box.great price,pos
"Great addition to my older ""dumb"" Samsung TV. I'm an Amazon Prime member so it made sense to purchase this to watch Prime Videos. Another great feature is the ability to load and use Playstation Vue app to stream cable television which has allowed me to discontinue my overpriced satellite TV service. My only con, was that the provided voice remote sometimes would lose connectivity and the buttons were rendered useless. Resetting the unit helps, but very annoying. Luckily, there's a Fire TV app for mobile devices for remote control. Overall, I do recommend this product.",pos
"Fast set up, 4k compatible and for more storage USB and SD card port.",pos
You will never go wrong with the Amazon Fire Box! Lets you watch so much more then your cable box!,pos
I could plug into an Ethernet outlet for faster speeds than wireless. It works great,pos
Works like a charm! We love having the option of regular tv or not!,pos
"This has a great UI. I've used all the different streaming devices and this is by far the cleanest, fastest, and offers a lot of app selections.Works great with Playstation Vue!",pos
Love this product. Will not go back to satellite or cable.,pos
Yes perfect for a bonus room can have Netflix and movies all at the same time,pos
"Had several fire sticks and thought let's try this. Got it in sale, it just so fast. Would recommend for sure!",pos
This thing works great. I highly recommend it. Good price on sale.,pos
Fire box is great. Easy start up and also to navigate thru for beginers in the streaming tv world.,pos
Works great. Fast uploading and doesn't take up any space.,pos
"It have lots of apps, you don't need cable tv if you own , only data svc",pos
"I like the overall performance, especially the remote. User interface can be better/improvement needed ... purchase of apps is automatic and need additional layers of checks/authentication",pos
"- A MUST for Amazon Prime subscribers - lots of media content - For PlayStation Vue subscribers, it's speedy and fast; works great- Noticeably faster than 1st generation Amazon Fire Stick- High-quality feel of the remote control- Smartphone App works grea",pos
Excellent alternative from cable. Easy to install and use. You don't need a high speed internet. The interface is very simple format. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is cutting the cord.,pos
"works great, good for the price. I canceled my cable subscription completely",pos
Needs to buffer less frequently than the current gen Fire stick. Plugged it in and was watching movies on Kodi within 45 minutes. Pretty happy with this.,pos
Very good media player with a lot of options and features.,pos
The product I got was the amazon fire box to go in my spare bedroom for guest instead of basic tv and defusing to pay cable service for an extra box.,pos
"We love the fire tv so much, we have one on every tv jn the house!",pos
"I am very satisfied with the Amazon TV. While I have used an Amazon Firestick, I bought this unit primarily because of the ethernet connection in order to get a faster streaming speed while watching TV shows and movies. Another nice feature is the USB connection. It makes it very easy to view and listen to music audios, videos and photos on a thumb drive.I recommend it to anyone who has internet hardwire options available.",pos
Installation was quick and I was watching in no time. Love the voice search and Alexa integration. Amazon integration is Perfect. Unfortunately the Voice Search only searches Amazon video and not Netflix like the Roku. For 4k this device supports 30fps and the Roku supports 60 fps. I don't know if that is a big deal yet or not until I get my 4K TV. I bought this because of the price point and I already had two Roku sticks. I also found that Amazon does NOT support certain movies on certain devices. i.e. I could not stream Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket on the Roku stick but it was available on the PS3. You have to look at Supported Devices in each movie to determine. When I started commenting on it in the Amazon forums they all of a sudden showed up :-)!,pos
I love these. Works great.nothing like plug and play.,pos
I'm able to screen mirror from my tablet and android.,pos
"Easy to install, nice alternative to cable great shows on demand.",pos
Good you guys did a goood job nice workers good job,pos
"The primary use is for Playstation Vue. The unit works very well and I have no regrets leaving Direct TV, so much cheaper. I haven't noticed a quality drop and am very happy with how the fire tv works.",pos
The Amazon Fire TV is the way to go! Very easy to set up and use!!! A++,pos
"So having this device has been great, Amazon prime aside, (as you can watch all of the great stuff Amazon has to offer if you are a Prime member) this devices allows excellent DLNA media streaming, access to online media applications such as netflix and many music sites as well.On my Smart TV i've always had an issue with the Netflix application crashing or not being able to connect for reasons unknown, and I constantly had to reset the entire ""Smart TV"" to get it working again ""maybe"".Using Netflix via the Fire TV, has never been easier, it actually makes the picture seem even more crisp than the native netflix application on my 4K Ultra HD 3D TV, go figure. the app doesn't crash on me, and i don't even use the Netflix app on the dumb i mean smart tv i have, i go right to the fire tv.This is a must have device for all things media.",pos
Love be my fire stick so much I bought 3 more for the house. I would recommend the fire tv but for less then $40 it's a steal!,pos
I works well for what it is. Great price and easy setup.,pos
By far my favorite product to stream from. I purchased the stick afterwards but it is no where near as reliable as the tv.,pos
It is doing what's it was advertised to do.i t working still,pos
Love this box. Streams really well and fast. Great for adults and kids,pos
I have several of the fire sticks. This is faster and works better than the fire stick.,pos
"This has much more space than the fire stick. Because of the extra memory space, the spreed and quality is great, to include less buffering.",pos
Amazon fire tv is a great product. It turns any tv into a smart tv. I watch all my movies and tv shows with the fire tv.,pos
The amazon fire TV box is the same as the firestick but its a quadcore processor instead of a dualcore,pos
We love our Amazon television box we want to order another one,pos
Hoping to replace cable TV in the near future. Works great.,pos
it's easy to set up and start enjoying Amazon Prime.,pos
"Best one yet, super speed, great pictures, 4k is awesome!",pos
Best thing on the market everybody just pick one of this up,pos
"I purchased this item, along with an HD antenna to finally cut the cable. Prices were getting out of control with the cable monopoly. This product really delivers. All the entertainment you could possibly want at your fingertips. I use it to stream PlayStation Vue. After experimenting with all devices. I feel this is by far the best. As smooth as a PS4, but easier to navigate with the remote. I also use it to stream Netflix as well as some of the free content. Overall an easy to use great product",pos
I have bought 6 Amazon fire tvs in the past and they are far better than chromecast and apple tv in terms of simplicity and volume. I highly recommend them.,pos

Well worth the money..............................,pos
"I managed to catch it on sale for 1299$ and use a 10% movers coupon to get it for about 1275$ after tax. TV works great and has a good picture, sound is whatever, but it's good enough for me.",pos
This box is very easy to program and to use. We can access all types of TV programs and movies. The voice command is very cool and save a great deal of time not havei g to type every thing you're searching for. Love It!!,pos
Much snappier than the fire stick highly recommend.,pos
"If you have Hulu, Netflix, amazon prime, etc... get this because you can control all of them from this device it's awesome and faster than the Fire stick and you can play games too gotta get the game controller totally worth it",pos
"I own an Nvidia Shield, which is the current Hulk of Android Tv. The Fire TV handles media heavy lifting with the same precision.",pos
Picked up one of thear love it easy to set up and install great price,pos
I love the options that you have with the fire box over other like products.,pos
"Works great, I can stream Netflix and a ton of other apps.",pos
"I bought this fire tv to try it out at my business. I didn't want to pay for cable or satellite, so I gave it a go. I'm happy I did, now I don't have to worry about anything. I have everything I need right there from music to movies. It keeps my guest happy so it's a win for me.",pos
"I love my amazon fire, would recommend to anyone. It is a good buy.",pos
"Love this player, I have purchased 3 already and will put one in each room. The quad core processor is very good",pos
I love this. It's has so much to offer for a great price. Super fast and easy to use!,pos
We are so happy with the fire stick! Our friends kept telling us to get one and I don't know why we waited so long!,pos
great streaming device for non smart hdtv. a must for any home,pos
"I was using Chromecast but this is a far better delivery system as far as picture quality and reliability. Also more choices of programming, of course.",pos
Great tv box that has a lot of capability over th competition.,pos
"We got the FireTV because a friend recommended it to us. We were stick of our cable bill constantly going up and this was the best optio! It's a onetime purchase fee and you can download an App called Kodi and you can watch live Tv, previously played shows, and movie you can think of and even sports. Granted sometimes the quality isn't the best, it's free!! We were paying almost $200 for cable and Internet and now I pay $60 for internet and nothing to stay up with my shows and sports!! Best purchase I have made in a long time!!",pos
"Very ideal for viewing movies, and th selections very updated!",pos
"i love the box better than the stick. For one i love that you can directly connect with an ethernet cord, usking the ultimate speeds, and that is has the android os which you can play with to get some of the best programs out there.",pos
Love this box so much. No longer need cable. Love being able to watch all my favorite movies and tv shows,pos
"works great easy to get connected and running, have not had any issues with buffering",pos
Purchased Fire TV while at Best Buy and this item was on sale. The Fire TV compared to the Fire Stick is much better.,pos
"Great for a good quality Android TV box. QUADCORE, Bluetooth remote and will accept a Bluetooth keyboard.",pos
I bought this to utilize PlayStation Vue. Works well,pos
"I love my Amazon box!! It's easy to use and with the right internet connection, there's no buffing or waiting for movies to download. I compared it to the Apple TV & for the overall money, this was the better purchase.",pos
"Found that this device is extremely convenient, but it often has problems with buffering. They seem to mostly come from outside apps so that's why I am still giving it a 4.",pos
This is a great device to have and use. I have two,pos
"I bought a new 65"" Visio and it doesn't ha e the smart tv that is integrated. Now you have to use a tablet which would be ok but I have to sync all the time and it is annoying. Amazon fire tv is awesome, much faster than the integrated programs on the TVs. I love it, allowed me to cut the cable.",pos
I love this box. Family time with my family a a very low price,pos
"Profound content provided by this TV box. Plus 3rd party apps, you can watch free tv and sports.",pos
Cut cable down to basic cable and now rent any shows that I watch directly from Amazon. Didn't realize how little TV I watched until I cancelled and went to Fire TV. My house is wired for LAN and I connect directly into the wall using a cat5 cable and have 80mps speed to the Fire TV. No issues with lag or buffering at all. 4k movies is a plus as well.,pos
You don't have to pay a high cable bill if you purchase product.,pos
It's exactly what it says it is. Really happy with it.,pos
Super easy to use. Has Alexa for voice commands. We've purchased 2 additional boxes for our other tv's.,pos
"Got this for our home gym to stream workout guides, Netflix, and music if - Super fast streaming, great quality build and performance, love the Alexa remote and integration with Amazon prime - all the apps and content u could ask for - haven't use the free time parental controls but that will be for our third one of these!",pos
"Amazon TV Box has got to be best bang for the buck. No other devices can match performance and price this offers. Great for gaming, movies, shows, and overall android platform.",neg
This box puts Roku and any other app box to shame!,pos
Excellent for streaming TV thru internet. Makes an excellent alternative to cable TV.,pos
Very easy to setup and use I would definitely recommend this,pos
I love this. Sold 4 Apple tvs including 4th generation.,pos
"Very user friendly. Easy set up, and works great with my amazon prime account.",pos
I could not be happier with my purchase. The channel options are great. Very easy to navigate around menu.,pos
"I liked Amazon Fire TV, it's powerful and the result is amazing.",pos
Same content but better. I wanted another one for my other tv.,pos
I'm a big fan of my Amazon Fire Tv. I really enjoy being to access my favor apps on one device.,pos
"If you want to stream video and use Kodi. This is the one to get. I bought this especially for the fact I could hard wire it to my router. No video pausing, skipping etc. Works great.",pos
This product is great and would buy for all my rooms in my home.,pos
"Much nicer than the competition, fast wifi or LAN hookup. The menu is fast and easy to work with. The voice search is helpful and works like Google search or Siri.",pos
Great when hacked with Kodi- especially with the Royalist!,pos
It is a great product for entertaining. Love Alexa on this but wish it would work with the echo,pos
Love it very easy to use and easy to install and run on tv,pos
I'm constantly using this to watch movies almost replaced the need for cable.,pos
"Like many others, I decided to cut cable and move to more online based video services. The Amazon Fire TV has easily become a centerpoint of our living room. We stream all of our favorite apps off this device (Amazon Video, Hulu, Netflix, NBC Live Extra, Playstation Vue, WATCH ESPN, and many more!).Pros: The Amazon Fire TV is portable and much more powerful than its little brother, the Fire TV Stick. The Fire TV has double the cores, double the RAM and has a slot for memory expansion when compared to the Fire Stick. Of course that all comes at a price, but its worth it. The Fire TV does not buffer nearly as often as my Fire Stick or Chromecast. This device is a 4K streaming device, but you'll need to find 4K content to take advantage of it.Cons: The experience from the get-go is VERY Amazon centric, with the platform optimized for searching and viewing Amazon video titles. I havent found the Voice Control to be of much use, as it is only really helpful for searching Amazon video.",pos
"I purchased this, so I could reduce my cable bill and I have to say, that I'm completely satisfied with Fire TV and the service I received from Best Buy, thank you!",pos
This FireTV is amazing in the way it can turn any tv into a smart tv. It is quick and responsive. We only using it for its streaming capabilities but so much more can be done with it. We also own a Firestick and they both seem the same for performance. So if you only plan on using its streaming capabilities you might want to look into the cheaper firestick.,pos
This a great add on for non smart (older) televisions with a USB port.,pos
"Love The Picture And Apps, Could Be Better Without The Apps That You Don't Want And Add Your Own",pos
Great picture. Easy to navigate and control. Loaded with entertainment,pos
A nice upgrade from my original Amazon TV Fire.The voice command feature has been flawless.A great purchase.,pos
Awesome for cutting the cable. Get access to movies and tv shows,pos
Great device to use for streaming tv shows & movie,pos
This product allows me to save over a hundred dollars on my cable bill.,pos
this is a great product with several streaming options.,pos
I cut the internet cord and I can't be happier!!! The Amazon Fire Tv offers so many apps and program options!! I wish I did this sooner.,pos
This next to the fire stick I must say have been the best pusrchases ive made to date. This takes over your cable and you can cancel your cable right away. Even more when you get kodi on it.,pos
Fire TV 4K version is a lot faster than the original version with a better chip set. The picture quality is excellent and navigation between apps is easy and intuitive. Also like the fact that you can load apps without a PC or Mac necessary.,pos
But even better with Kodi! Love the 4K! The remote could be better,pos
This has everything we were looking for as far as apps and games go. Easy to use and set up.,pos
"This was recommended to me. Good product, can avail Amazon prime and will automatically get hook up & have an access to it.",pos
I absolutely love the fire tv box... It's amazing!,pos
"Excellent product. Noticeably faster than the fire stick. I use it with my Tablo DVR, SlingTV, and Kodi. With this there is nothing else you will need.",pos
This was purchased for a 2nd TV. No issues- love it,pos
This is very fast and no buffering for non Amazon movies. I definitely recommend this product. I got this one in deal not paying full price at Best buy beats the others in price and product performance.,pos
"Works great, no connection issues! It has all the apps I need that roku would have",pos
"Purchased this to replace my ATV to allow use of Playstation Vue. As a huge Apple user, I expected it to be a sacrifice but I love this even more than my ATV.",pos
Great the service was great and I really like it.!,pos
I would not purchase this item again as there is no 4K content.,neg
This item is a waste of money as none of the content is 4K. Buy the much cheaper Fire TV Stick instead.,neg
I purchased this because have become a cord cutter and this was highly recommended by a good friend as a worthy streaming box. I was pleasantly how fast and responsive it is and future proof with the added 4K functionality. Only downside is that it has a tremendous amount of amazon bloatware which I understand but it is constantly present.,pos
"Love it, its so easy to setup and use. The box is powerful and keeps up with everything that I am streaming, including games. This is a great unit and I have had no issues with it. Highly recommend. Also, check out some of the other apps you can load on this device, its very open and there is a lot you can do with it. If you're into electronics and having a great home entertainment setup then this is a must have.",pos
I am really impressed with Amazon box. The processor is really fast and responsive. Has one of the better remotes out there.,pos
"I have tried the Roku and Vizio streaming boxes, and Fire TV blows them away. I have also tried several streaming sticks. The Fire TV box is more responsive, has a higher quality remote, and Alexa adds fantastic value with speech commands that are fantastically integrated. For those wanting to utilize 4k streaming this is a great start with small investment.",pos
I love this device and it has changed my tv/movie viewing for the better!,pos
I have 3 amazon fire sticks already. The box runs a little faster and I haven't experienced any lag times with the menus. The voice control works surprisingly well.,pos
Love the fire box! Quick and easy to navigate. I watch all my faves in the apps and cut the chord with my cable company!,pos
This Amazon fire TV stick is faster than the older versions. I have not had any buffering while using this device.,pos
Love the fire stick. And the price wad the best price compared to other stores,pos
"What's great about the Fire TV is it's great interface, and frankly it's affordability. If you want 4K streaming, a fast fluid interface, then this is what you want! The nVidia Shield is great, and yeah it's powerful... and plays games, but for the price, and if you just want to stream it's not worth it. The selection of Android games is so limited, don't waste your money! I've also been turned off by the Roku interface, it seems too kiddish, and just not as intuitive. I am using these Fire TV devices through out the house to stream Live TV, and my movie collection through an app called Emby. It's a fantastic experience for the whole family and saves me a bundle on rental fees from the cable company, and electricity due to it's low power consumption. If you want just want to stream, and play your home movie collection this is what you want!",pos
This product was easy to install. It allows me to view things on my television I previously could not. Now I have a smart tv plus it gives me access toMany other websites and viewing options.,pos
The Fire TV works great and is very fast. Some apps are in the cloud but others have to be purchased through Amazon. Only problem was getting battery cover off of remote,pos
It's show everything in great view of videos and..,pos
works great and you can customize it. very nice with the voice remote,pos
"Love the firetv box. It is faster than the firestick, had more storage space n allows for ethernet cable connection for more stable connection. If u get a tv with roku built in there can be interference between box n tv. Dont get roku built in tv with this box.",pos
"I decided to buy the Amazon firestick tv after already purchasing firestick based on the fact that firestick tv box is 4K quality . And it does not disappoint ! If you have a better picture quality tv , definitely recommend the higher quality firestick tv to get the best picture possible ;-)",pos
Works really well only wish it had larger memory for streaming better on slower network,pos
Don't hesitate to buy. Very user friendly platform.,pos
"It is a great decent device to have around, super fast streaming without getting over heated.",pos
I find this product is far better Han Apple TV. Otis easy to use the controls are smooth and it's extremely compact.,pos
Great product. I love it. Best thing I every got. I would recommend.mend this product to everyone.,pos
"great, always a great time vising the store of my choice",pos
We purchased this after wanting to get rid of satellite tv and save money. We wanted to try PlayStation vue and needed an option for another tv. This has. Even a great addition and we love it. Very good interface and we don't miss satellite at all! We have been enjoying many of the free games as well. This is a great choice.,pos
Works great! Just wish it worked with Alexia. Way more features than Apple TV.,pos
this is easy to setup even for the wife. 9 year old son is a wiz at this already.,pos
This is a great item. I connected it with no problem. The streaming features are awesome.,pos
"Excellent product, works really well...love it....",pos
I returned one of my cable boxes and just use my AMZN fire. I love that I can use the voice command. Super easy set up.,pos
this is the fastest streaming device amazon offers you will not be diapointed,pos
"It is very fast and reliable, it is everything it says it is...",pos
"It is so nice to have all these streaming services in one box, and the voice command feature works great! Smooth UI with no lag, especially compared to it's little brother, the Fire Stick. My only complaint is that there is no 4K Resolution support.",pos
"I was quite surprised by the ease with of setting this up. The voice control with Alexa works great, far exceeded my expectations. Great picture quality and a good selection of shows and movies.",pos
A little confusing at first but once you get the hang of it it's very satisfying,pos
"I have Amazon Prime and this makes it so easy to watch movies or tv shows. HULU, Netflix and many other ways to watch what you want when you want to watch it. I am now ready to cut the cable.",pos
The fire tv is worth every penny. I have not had any issues with my device,pos
I own an Apple TV also and content is just as good. Very easy to navigate. I also use my phone's app to navigate thru the menu.,pos
I love the Amazin FireTV stick! I have one in every room of the house and don't have to worry about a cable bill ever again.,pos
"Good performance for most apps. However, I primarily purchased it to watch PS Vue, and although the PS Vue app is better than on Roku, it suffers from more lag and glitches than watching PS Vue via PS4 or PS3.",pos
"I love my amazon fire tv, there are a lot of great features. I highly recommend it.",pos
Ok I need to learn how to use it I would recommend,pos
This has a great menu and its a lot easier to find then the apps on the tv. Its much quicker then the fire stick,pos
"I am an Amazon Prime member and decided to take advantage of Prime Video and Prime Music. I recently ""cut the cord"" on cable and subscribed to SlingTV. Amazon Fire TV works great with SlingTV and many other apps listed in the description. The menu design is simple and easy to use. It is a great purchase and you can get even more out of your Amazon Prime membership with the Amazon Fire TV",pos
"This works much better than the fire stick. There is no buffering at all with movies and tv. Ended up buy 2 more,.",pos
This is a great alternative to cable/box. Saves $.,pos
"I am extremely happy with the box, well over the stick. Twice as fast, twice as much RAM and up to almost 30 times as much memory",pos
It's a great product that allowed me to cancel cable television.,pos
"I am very happy with this device. I've tried many different solutions to get to a good cord cutting setup and this is by far the best. From cheap Android sticks, to Roku, to Chromecast, to small form factor PCs, this is the best compromise between size, performance, and price. We use it primarily with PlayStation Vue but also with Amazon Prime. Interestingly enough it has become our preferred device for Netflix as well, even though Netflix is built-in to our Samsung TV. The Bluetooth remote is very good, even though the voice search/Alexa services are little more than a novelty. To be truly useful Amazon needs to open voice search to other apps. I'd love to be able to say ""watch CNN on PlayStation Vue"". My biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps. For example, there is a free CBS app for Android but the app for the FireTV requires a subscription. Yes, you can side load apps but that defeats the simplicity that makes this device great. Similarly, the lack of Google Play Movies and Google Play Music is regrettable.On a side note, if you don't plan to play demanding games, the new FireTV Stick (quad core) is just as competent a devices as this one, for less than half the price. But I cannot recommend the old FireTV stick. One little advertised feature that I absolutely love is that the device will also connect to Bluetooth headsets. Awesome if you want to listen you a show in bed without disturbing others.",pos
Good product good service...attended real good.Find product ok.,pos
Great way to save on cable. Wifi enabled so really simple to install.,pos
Had a fire stick and loved it. Eventually got this because I wanted the 4K capabilities. My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner. I use it for sling tv a lot as well.,pos
I'm really enjoying my amazon fire tv. I should have bought it a long time ago. Alexa is a very cool feature.,pos
"We got the new Amazon fire TV as we got a new 4K tv. Right now there is still not as much 4K content as I would like, however it does 4K very well. Netflix and Amazon prime have a few 4K tv shows and movies that are available if you have a 4K tv, but the New Fire TV also has upgraded internals and faster wireless making everything much snappier. I would recommend a wired connection if you can, streaming will look much better and pause much less often.",pos
My kid enjoys watching his cartoons on the fire tv,pos
"Nice interface, easy to use. Smooth, no buffering.",pos
"But, fast forwarding through content can reset the cursor and put you at the beginning of the content. And, occasionally can get you out of the application. Perhaps additional memory in a future version of this product may fix this. However, watching subscription free content is always a treat.Good solid product. I also own Roku and its interface slightly easier for elderly and those with not much patience.",pos
This is an excellent piece. We use is it mainly for Netflix but there are so many other features yet to explore.,pos
love the fire tv box. its faster and runs a little better than the firestick. Both are great products. love that you can add 3rd party apps to them for even more movie and tv options.,pos
Use it daily. Because of its streaming capabilities and how clear it is I'm saving a ton of money from not having cable,pos
I'm getting rid of my DirecTV subscription for this. I love it! I don't have to forward through commercials :),pos
"super easy to use with great video quality, love it",pos
"This unit has a powerful processor, load contents very quick and stream the movie so smooth.",pos
Cut the cable. save money. we love it and recommend,pos
My Fire TV has it so much easier moving away from cable.,pos
I love this box with its bigger memory capabilities. Looks great on my 4k tv,pos
This thing in unbelievable.. Why did I wait so long to buy!??,pos
Got the fire stick and the fire tv. I like that I can plug the tv straight to the router with Ethernet cable. Seems to load pages faster and streams better with sling tv. Both are great items.,pos
Very easy to use and Alexa is awesome! App store has anything you could want in it too.,pos
Great for streaming TV/ movies. I hardly ever have interruptions.,pos
It is worth it to upgrade from the firestick to the fire tv. The UI is a lot smoother and easier to navagate.,pos
"We love the Amazon Fire. It is so easy to hook up and so easy to use.Great resource for movies, watching series and just about anything you could be interested in.",pos
"I purchased this to remove cable, and the crazy high monthly bill. It works great, I don't miss a show, and save $75 a month! We'll worth it!",pos
Works very well.fast and great if you have a prime account.,pos
Love the fire stick! I have been recommending it to all my friends.,pos
Software is fast and easy to use. If you are a Amazon Prime member this is the streamer to buy.,pos
We love it. Great product We heard about it from family,pos
"Works great, several apps for my kids to choose from.",pos
I like this item because it has an eathernet port and is very fast .,pos
I can't believe I've wasted my money on cable all these years. I'm really happy with my purchase.,pos
Couldn't wait to get my hands on the fire tv. Better than the Apple TV,pos
Cant say enough good things about this product....we also have the fire sticks for other tvs.....This sure does beat paying for cable. It is very easy to set up and use.,pos
Fire tv has great features and if one of the best boxes being sold,pos
I liked the amazon stick so much I upgraded to an amazon fire. I'm very happy with the purchase.,pos
"cause if you didnt know, now you know.. but u knew",pos
This is an awesome box to have. Makes it easy to watch all your shows.,pos
Love my Fire TV box (along with two other Fire TV sticks) and downloaded Playstation Vue to watch TV and sports channels at half the cost of my monthly cable and past satellite TV bills.,pos
My hole family loves it we don't even watch cable tv any more,pos
Got this mainly to watch Sony vue tv. Just got sick. And tired of cable and satellite prices going up and up. Lots of other neat stuff you can do with this also. Prime. Is also great source,pos
So far so good. My son loves it for his room and gives him ability to watch netflix,pos
"This is great. Stream all the Prime Video plus your normal stuff on YouTube Netflix, etc.",pos
"Great for streaming movies and amazon, easy set up! Would defiantly recommend this product.",pos
Better price point than apple TV but in comparison for what I am interested in prefer Apple TV,pos
It is very simple to set up on your tv we were going to run a cable to the other tv in the bedroom but it was less money to purchase the fire stick,pos
The Best Android Based Set-Top Box For it's Price.Amazon outdid themselves here with their Fire TV line. They got it right and they do not appear to be abandoning this anytime soon so hop on now while it's still hot.,pos
"The best streaming box on the market, hands down...just buy it, thank me later!",pos
"good for the price, better than i expected. highly reccommend",pos
Great streaming device would definitely recommend this to anybody,pos
Very easy to load up exodus and watch what every you wanna watch. With kodi. Never pay for cable againHave already recommended this to a few friends. They are all happy,pos
Finally decided to cut the cables. Will be able to save at least $200/month. One of the best decisions I have made thus far.,pos
it works very well for a small black box on my concil.,pos
"Great device for tv show, movies, and supports 4k.",pos
Awesome product! I use for all rooms in my house. Streams fast and it is very easy to use. I wish the remote was set up a little bigger. Overall it's a great product.,pos
"Me and my family we love amazon fire tv.You can find any tv show,movies ,all kind of streaming apps.some paid some free.",pos
"We don't have the best wifi in our house which caused the firestick to continually buffer. Since getting the fire tv we almost never have buffering, it's quicker and much more reliable.",pos
I have about every single streaming player on the market. This one is not better or worse than the others. I got it only for using 3rd party apps. For that it works flawlessly! If you need a streaming device this one will fit the bill.,pos
"amazon-fire tv, easy install,very easy to start using.",pos
I purchased this to watch PlayStation Vue which it does very well. It is relatively small and does to make any noise that I can detect.,pos
bought this unit as a door price at work . my fellow employees went bananas when they seen this as a prize option. last x- mas I gave away the fire stick and that was a big hit,pos
Very easy to use and has a bunch of great features. The voice remote and app make it even better.,pos
"Ever since I had my fire TV jail broken and programmed, I can finally cancel my cable subscription. Everything I once paid for on cable, my fire TV (KODI app) does for FREE!!!!!",pos
"Easy to use, great product. Cost is great, many features.",pos
I have several sticks and they eventually get glitchy and need to be rebooted. The box never does this. It also runs faster and responds better at all times. Get the box not the stick.,pos
"navigation needs more work, no pointer feature sucks, definitely NOT a point-and-click systemes explore for web browsing is antiquated and needs replacedvoice alexa feature does NOT work inside apps to control the app, so careful what you say or needless purchases are madeno disable option for voice featurestill one of the cheapest ways to run kodi program direct to telly in HDMI tho.one can still load app for plex server for NAS playback via streaming, though it is extremely difficult to navigate the plex download page in es explore.its faster than old version, has Bluetooth 4.1 instead of 3.1, has a quad-core instead of dual-core processor, and doesn't seem to get hot after hours of play like old version did.But, If Amazon ever blocked third party apps like kodi and plex I would never buy an amazon product again tho.Not an amazon prime member and never will be, why pay for programming that I can get for free.",pos
Hate using cable very easy to use. Family is enjoying using it.,pos
Easy to setup easy to use! Works great and easy to get started love it,pos
"Fast, lots of content. Right step towards cutting the cord.",pos
Really enjoyed this like the hard wire instead of wi-fi great apps very easy to understand,pos
Very fast response to the different apps and looks great with my 4K tv,pos
I purchased strictly for PS VUE and can confirm it works great including 60FPS and lag-free (almost as good as PS4) guide navigation. It is drastically improved in speed over the 2nd gen fire stick ($40) which had too much navigation lag and capped at 30FPS. The Fire TV is much faster and worth the extra money as it also includes 4K and a gigabit ethernet port. It does lack VUDU and Google Play so not all apps are available and will not likely be available due to Amazon Prime proprietary service. Overall it functions great and is very FAST!,pos
This amazon fire tv box is one of the best media devices available.,pos
Easy to use and A smoother interface than others like it,pos
This makes core cutting so easy. So many apps and shows it's almost limitless. Coupled with all the amazon prime content you can go wrong. Easy setup and easy to use,pos
"DO not waste your time with the fire stick. Get the box, better remote and faster processor. Does its job and great for Kodi.",pos
Fire TV delivers. Good device with a very easy to use interface. Easy to set up.,pos
Love it. I would recommend to anyone who like streaming tv.,pos
Great product. This is the best streaming box out there besides the Nvidia Shield TV but much more affordable. I'm thinking of getting another one.,pos
Very good and easy to use and to set up. Use it more than regular tv.,pos
"i love this product, it works great and for a great price",pos
Wonderful product. Very happy to be cable free! Highly recommend!,pos
Love the speed and apps offered through the unit. Had eliminated most of the buffering issues I've had with other streaming sticks.,pos
Lots of programs that I didn't know was available. Quick easy setup and hours of free entertainment.,pos
Purchased this so I can use Bluetooth headphones with it. Works perfectly! I use it everyday!!! Awesome buy!!!,pos
I don't know what took me so long to purchase this item system offers everything that could want for my tv experience in one package.,pos
"I like the speed of the fire TV .I use to have a fire TV stick ,then upgraded to the fire tv: I'm very satisfied",pos
Enjoy using my fire tv I have taken it out of town and it hook up just fine,pos
"It's fast, n I love the expandable memory slot, I love how my tv remote can control it also deff worth buying",pos
"This is the best streaming device in the market. Fast & easy setup. Allows u2 program it and hookup peripheral devices such as mouse, keyboard.Firestick is only 2.4Ghz, so make sure to get the box. It also has ability to stream via hardwire.",pos
I a few of them for gifts for Christmas. I love mine and I thought they would enjoy them too.,pos
"Out of all the other media sources, this is my favorite one. It's a lot user friendly, and has more options to do things with this media device.",pos
This media streamer is good. I like the voice feature.,pos
This is our second box for our bedroom. We got our first over a year ago when we decided we were't paying a $200 cable bill each month. We have no complaints at all.,pos
i love this its is very good to have its different,pos
I really enjoy my fire stick . Has a lot of movie entertainment for the family.,pos
I love my fire TV it's an amazing product I liked it so much I went out and bought fire sticks for the rest of the TVs in my house,pos
Excellent media streaming device. Could easily take the place of about 4 different boxes under your television.,pos
After using the Amazon Fire Stick for about 6 months I decided to upgrade to the Fire TV and it is so much faster and I can hardwire it directly into my network unlike the fire stick which is only wireless.,pos
Convenient to use. Can take it with you when traveling,pos
one of the best media player options for streaming TV,pos
Like the hardware. Both box and the remote control is very aethetic and nice to use. processor is fastest by the time I bouth it and still fast enough for my system. Liked that I could install android apps.I wish they implemented NTFS for the microSD card file system. It is limited to FAT32 that limits a file size less thn 4GB. No power off switch is another bummer. But overall I chose this over Roku 3 (or even 4).,pos
I got tired of high cable bills and joined the cord cutting stampede. This works great and I save $100 a month. I also got a deal for half off the antenna for local channels when I bought it. Can't go wrong.,pos
I use this to have many TVs running at the same time without having to pay for cable.,pos
I love the Fire TV because I can stream all NFL games with the Kodi app and all of my Prime shows.,pos
This does everything i need and want it to do. All extras in one place.,pos
OTT= Over the Top digital television is the wave of the future for the TV industry. Amazon Fire TV is leading this revolution.,pos
Very universal in use and was of applications. Real quick in response,neg
"Very easy to use/navigate. User-friendly interface. Only con is that it's a bit sluggish for the avid user, which was just improved in the 3rd generation of the Fire Stick (better processor).",pos
I bought the fire stick but wanted something a little bigger for my den with more storage. So I looked at the amazon tv and it was exactly what I wanted.,pos
This box is on par or better than the competition when combine with Amazon Prime. 4 stars because I feel it's time the internals get an upgrade.,pos
These boxes are simply amazing! Great for everyone,pos
Would purchase again. Great product. It is easy to install. You tube was very helpful to me with the installation of my Amazon Fire stick.,pos
"great product, i would recommend this product to family and friends",pos
One of the best media streamers out there right now.,pos
I would recommend this for anyone. Real happy with it.,pos
This item helps my parents enjoy TV viewing easier with its overall simplicity.,pos
Rather would have the fire stick as it is smaller and cheaper. I feel as though it has the same features.,neg
This is a great means of watching lots of programs,pos
"I had used Roku, Nvidia Shield, Apple TV and Smart TV's digital feed. This device does the heavy lifting effortlessly, at $100.00 price point and allows the versitility of android tv customization.The Apple and Android Smart Phone Remote app trumps all the others.Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner.",pos
Tried the Roku 3 on a set and recently added this to another. Really like the ease of use and voice search feature. Would prefer less an amazon centered home page - otherwise a 5 star product.,pos
Great gadget. Cancelled all my movie channels adfter buying it.,pos
I don't have cable so it would not be valuable to me,neg
"This Amazon Fire TV box and remote is a great option to save money, and eliminate long term cable subscriptions. I should have purchased this years ago...",pos
"Far exceeded my expectations. Very simple setup. Having Amazon Prime makes this purchase a ""no brainer""",pos
"I picked this over the fire stick due to the user interface for PS vue, it's a much cheaper alternative to paying for cable.",pos
Works but has a tendency to freeze or get slow. Probably wouldn't purchase again,neg
Very pleased experience installation and setup....,pos
After using one at a relative's house I finally decided to purchase one of these. I've struggled with the slowness of smart tv built in apps or even the apps on my bluray player and this was finally the solution to that. It's fast and has tons of content.,pos
I do like the Amazon fire TV. There are a few things I do not like. Mainly the layout of the menus amd getting around. To many duplicates displayed and to many pay for shows mixed in. Even with prime there are things you have to pay for. There is an option to see only prime but you have to set it each time and that blows. They really need to work on thier menus.,pos
I bought this not really knowing any Amazon products and I gotta say.... it has become one of my top 5 gadgets! It's aweomse!!!!!!!! I've made my sisters get one too!!!!!,pos
"I had this for over 3 months and I'm liking this more and more. It has a lot of potential. 1st of, hardware wise. It's the best of the bunch. It can support up to a 4k display, has an Ethernet port and a microsd slot. It's small and compact so I can tuck it way from sight. This is fast. Virtually little to no lag. Everything is smooth and responsive. If I did have to complain, it's the time to start up the unit from a cold start. 2nd, It's based of of Android so the potential to root and install a media player is a possibility. 3rd, rarely has any buffering issue. Why did I bring this up. It all depends on your provider. When I has FIOS and hardwire the Fire player to the router, it keeps buffering. I don't know why. I have 50 up/down. When I changed providers, TWC/Spectrum, I have Zero buffering issues. To me, I think FIOS is throttling HD contents.To sum it up, this is way better than the stick because of the hard-wiring capabilities. MircoSD slot for expandable and this is freaking fast then the stick. Well worth the extra $30-$40.",pos
Great improvement from the original version and much better than apple tv,pos
I like the amazn tv because it allowes me to watch everyhting using one device,pos
Wonderful item. Works well with current set-up. Highly recommend.,pos
The fire tv is super easy to use an super fast compared to the fire stick. Easy setup an all.,pos
This is a great product. Great tv and awesome for family content.,pos
Was looking for something that would work with most apps when cutting the cord and chose this. Works as stated and way faster than even the new smart TV's processors. All but got rid of the annoying buffering times.,pos
If you want to save money and cut your cable bill this is the way to go.I am now saving over $80 a month because of all the stations that I get now on Amazon Fire Tv.,pos
I bought both this and the fire stick. I like the box better becuase it has more storage than the stick. It's also easy to use and operate. All in all I think it's a good purchase and would recommend it.,pos
"Easy to setup, customizable, and affordable android box. Highly recommended for your android needs.",pos
Great product and holds a lot of memory. Sometimes it is hard to get a movie started.,pos
We love this product and enjoy streaming movies and such.,pos
Was very impressed by the quality of the picture would recommend to everyone.,pos
This is much faster then the firestick.will work with amazon echo. Voice remote works great!!,pos
"Good Average device for internet content but for 4K forget about it, but if your looking for a simple HD content is good enough.",pos
The Amazon fire TV is an excellent addition to our household entertainment setup! The ease of use is appreciated and the show content is perfect for my needs.,pos
"No buffer, quick respond, and awesome remote control.",pos
Wouldn't be able to live without this box! It has never let me down.,pos
I recommend this to everyone! Love having all my videos in one spot and easy to use! Plus parental controls to stop purchases and restrict shows!,pos
"Bought the voice fire stick, that is a nice feature. The ease of navigation in the apps is nice because of the streamlined interface. I am happy with the buy.",pos
"We purchased this device when we switched from cable to PlayStation Vue. It works great for that, but we have found we also enjoy watching Amazon movies and listening to Amazon music as well. If you're an Amazon prime member this is a no-brainer. We also enjoy that it is simple for our 9 and 10 year old children to use.",pos
I have purchased the fire stick in the past. Now the box does everything the stick does and I can expand the memory which is a huge plus for me. Also being able to plug directly into a cat5 cable helps with streaming..,pos
"We are throughly enjoying our Amazon TV. We first bought the Amazon Stick, but realized we need more space and put the TV in our bonus room. Both have allied us to reduce our cable bill. :)",pos
Amazon fire tv the only way to go love mine better than Apple TV .,pos
"We recently cut out our satellite service and switched to the Amazon fire TV...we haven't looked back. Very fast, easy to install, and very compact. I do recommend getting the one with the voice command, it's very convenient. The only thing is to just make sure your wifi internet is up to date and fast.",pos
I needed a stream player to cut cable . So I went with the amazon tv. Has it all internal storage and capability to add a SD card. Works great with kodi,pos
"I have used them all, but when it comes to performance this tops them all. Its a very powerful device. Especially if you LAN wire it, I hardly experience buffering with my streams. Perfect for open-source media players such as Kodi and Plex.",pos
Yes i recommend this item. It's also a good price.,pos
"Purchased this TV as a birthday present, and it didn't disappoint! She absolutely loves it, raves about it all the time! Great sound, display and was easy to mount.",pos
Nice Amazon Product to have it. Magnolia configured it with my Home theater system and works well!!,pos
Got this to replace a fire stick. It stands without buffering and I love the voice remote.,pos
Use my Fire TV all the time to watch movies and play games. Sign up for Prime and watch tons of movies for free.,pos
It has alex built in so you don't even need a amazon eco,pos
"What a way to enjoy all the entertainment in your very own house, I highly recommend that you get one too!",pos
"The Fire TV fills my need for a streaming device. I'm able to access PS Vue, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other channel apps. The remote and interface are intuitive and simple and Alexa is a nice add-on feature. Much recommended for anyone looking for a streaming device.",pos
I am happy with this purchase. I've always wanted one. Works great.,pos
Is a great product and a fantastic entertainment. The hole family is around it at home washing videos and series. It is also compatible with others programs and apps.,pos
"This is easily the best media player around. Solid hardware, blazing fast and snappy nice user interface and a ton of apps. Highly recommend",pos
"We had a streaming movie box that had Kodi pre-loaded. Even though the box was capable of speeds up to 100 mbps, it seemed to always buffer or just stop. We bought the Amazon fire because it supports up to 200 mbps and supports 4k as well. I rarely have any issues now. Also the number of apps this will run is great.",pos
Great product!! I have several fire tv boxes and firesticks and these boxes are just amazing!! So much faster than the firesticks,pos
Amazon fire tv is a great product save a lot of money not paying high cable prices,pos
I love the fire tv. I already had the fire stick and decided to give this a try for the living room. I'm very happy with it. Love the fact that I can hook it up through LAN so I doesn't buffer anywhere near as much as the stick,pos
Much better than the fire stick has a lot of memory and processor so it's very fast between menus. most likely will buy another one for another TV,pos
"I returned this product after deciding to standardize on one streaming technology. I chose Roku because of reputation, the Best Buy salesperson's recommendation, and the included headphones with Roku.",neg
Absolutely amazing. A must have for the home and Ethernet connection makes internet connection fast and reliable,pos
Very stable system. Pretty much identical to fire stick. Only pay more money to stream limited 4k content.,pos
"Minimizes buffering, don't have to have wireless internet. Seems to load faster then the stick.",pos
The Fire TV itself is great for streaming various media over our wireless network to our TV in our sun room. At first we thought we'd have to get an extender but we got lucky and everything runs pretty smoothly. The applications are fast and responsive and the menus are easy enough to navigate for the young one in the house. The only thing we aren't happy with is that the remote chews through batteries pretty quickly. I have a Logitech Harmony remote that has a LCD screen on it and it doesn't go through batteries as fast the Fire TV remote. We now remove the batteries whenever the remote is not in operation. An annoyance but not a deal breaker.,pos
"This is a nice item to get especially when your husband is a movie buff. It will allow you to go to extended channels in order to watch whatever taste you may have for watching TV.. It allows you watch all kinds of sports from soccer, to football, to baseball to lacrosse, to whatever interests you.",pos
You can play games and watch youtube on it. I bought it for the younger ones to keep them entertained.,pos
Time to disconnect from Cable TV and save $150 monthly. Can get almost every channel I need with out the cable TV expense. Takes some getting used to and planning but all in all a good choice.,pos
The picture looks better running netflix on this than apple tv.,pos
"Great product, easy to hook up and use. Alexa is easy to use as well.",pos
Over all the product is good batteries that are supplied seem to of been dead but other wise very good,pos
Great device to stream movies or TV shows either wireless or connected with ethernet connection,pos
I found this unit easy to setup. It also allowed me to view my Netflix account without wearing out my PlayStation .,pos
Great product. Being able to connect to the modem directly is great. Solves some of the streaming issues normally associated with using wifi.,pos
Great item for the price. Love the fact that you can hard wire to your internet for lightning fast streaming.,pos
This is a perfect device for the novice that expects superior performance and doesn't mind paying a little extra. No buffering and excellent 1080 quality.,pos
Very easy to use. Great for travel. Access to many many movies.,pos
I love it it is so easy to use it and I can safely everything I want.,pos
this box is definitely better than the fire stick. if you have amazon prime and Netflix you don't really need cable with this box.,pos
"We purchase this amazon fire TV for one of my TVS that is not smart and e are very happy with it, we used to watch Hulu, Amazon TV, it is very fast and we haven't had any problems.",pos
Amazon Fire TV navigates with ease except for downloading to ES file.,pos
Works great once you get the hang of it. Overall happy with it,pos
"I cut my cable. Easy to use, easy to install. My son did it for me, but I could have by myself.",pos
"If you have slow internet like myself get this one, not the fire stick. I have 3mb internet and at times buffers at 1080p but when switched to 720 almost no buffering. That's an issue on my side not the device. Easy to tranfer apps from android phone using app called apps2fire available at the play store. Most apps transferred work but not all of them. 3rd party game pads work also via Bluetooth. A+++",pos
I have plenty of Firesticks. This is an upgrade. Lets me stream faster because it has a faster processor. Family loves it. It knocks down the cable bills.,pos
Much better than a fire stick. Well worth the extra money.,pos
this is a great product best on the market will recommend,pos
I have cut the cord because of this item because of that I'm saving a ton of money,pos
Works fine and I am pleased with my purchase. I would purchase again.,pos
"This little box gives you endless TV episodes, tons of movies, 5 million songs, And Photo storage and display when linked to an Amazon prime account. It also allows you to get apps from all over the place and even play games. I am also streaming live TV with Vue thru this little tiny, shiny, black box. I am impressed.",pos
Incredible download speed bigger remote super responsive in selection Increased wifi range better bandwidth Definitely would recommend if you are in the market to buy a streaming media device,pos
I am very happy with my fire tv. It's makes me want to buy another to go in my son's room.,pos
THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR STREAMING .THE PRICE IS THE BEST PART .IT IS EASY TO SETUP.I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT.,pos
"This is the product to get you can watch movies, tv shows, play games what else do you need come on go down to your local best buy and purchase one right now",pos
We have joined the modern world and now have access to more viewing opportunities than we imagined. The best part is that this technology allows us to speak our request.,pos
Works great as a streaming devise. Menu interfaces are easy to navigate.,pos
I would buy this product again; would also recommend it to friends and family.,pos
I have a smart TV but the Fire TV is faster and extremely more flexible. It is the best value of all units I reviewed. I have highly recommend the Fire TV and Fire Stick to my friends. They too have purchased and love it.,pos
Some problems streaming Netflix but everything else works perfectly,pos
Us good for My family I recommend yo My Friends good programs good signal,pos
"I've had the Fire Stick version of the Fire TV for quite a while, but finally went for the more powerful unit. This little guy is great, does a fine job of bringing in the Amazon offerings as well as playing some casual games (we tried some trivia and other simple games). The voice control is excellent. Overall I am very pleased with this unit. If I had to come up with something they could improve, it would be the feel of the remote. It has a bit of a fragile/flimsy feel to it.",pos
"Love my amazon fire! Easy to hook up and use. Even better if you are an Amazon Prime member. Music, movies, Netflix, Hulu & many more.",pos
I like it better than Ruko. You can also install your own kodi apps,pos
Great addition to the TV! Quick plug and play and very easy to use!!!,pos
"Replaced my Nexus Player with this. Much snappier and better network connections (mostly due to the wired ethernet). Have yet to try it on the 4K TV, but it's very easy to use and works well with Netflix and Plex.",pos
Didn't already said great! Minimum fifty characters?,pos
I hate this product,neg
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done",neg
many problems,neg
Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.,neg
heating problem,neg
battery is not good,neg
not recommended,neg

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",pos

"decent item, alot of ppl i know use it to watch movies and tv shows that are current since they dont want cable. Works well but only if you have decent WI-FI otherwise there is lag. Still glad I bought it!",pos
"FireTV box is a lot better than the FireStick...Awesome device, just had an issue with one firestick freezing up a lot but was easily returned when i brought it back to the store. no verification was needed and they exchanged it for a new one. I use them to have Kodi on them and i have a total of 4 in different rooms. They do freeze up sometimes when running a big build or a big app on them which gets annoying... then i use the FireTV which is better and can handle more than the stick can.",pos
I bought this to replace my old roku 2 and i am completely satisfied with the purchase.,pos
This saved me on my cable bill. Good quality. thanks,pos
Amazon Fire TV is real easy to setup and use......,pos
Very easy to use set up was really use I love all of the channels,pos
Works Perfect and woujld highly recommend.Was easy to set up!,pos
Highly better alternative then the Fire Stick. Faster UI and perferomance compared to the Fire Stick.,pos
Could not be easier to set up and use. WiFi is flawless if ethernet is not available. Loaded with content.,pos
"Love this Amazon Fire TV. I hooked it up to my bedroom TV and started watching all of my favorite shows on Netflix, and other apps that comes on this! Great!",pos
"Started with appleTV. Traded those in for Roku, wasn't happy and switched to Amazon Fire Tv. Couldn't be happier.",pos
The amazon 4K is amazing. Way better than the stick. The box runs smoother than the stick and wor,pos
Comes in handy when staying at hotels you can connect and find your shows.,pos
"This is the best by far I brought a different kind and had a lot of problems purchased the amazon stick and had no problem streaming movies,shows or playing games",pos
Purchased my Amazon Fire after my Roku was acting up and had complications with PS Vue. Everything runs fast and smooth over my WiFi.,pos
My first experience with a streaming device it has been very easy to learn how to use,pos
This product cuts our cable bill in half! Quality is great. You can literally watch anything old or new!,pos
Love it. Great price. Great features. Easy to set up and can just use double side tape to hide right behind tv.,pos
"After trying Apple TV, I'm happy with Amazon fire. The remote is great and easy set up",pos
It's my only access to television these days. All I need is a wifi internet connection to the house. I have thoroughly enjoyed using it. It works great.,pos
I like this much better than the roku that we had and more options,pos
Just love that breadth of tv entertainment available from this!,pos
"I love this product. The fact that I can connect the fire tv to an Ethernet cable is one of the best perks imo. It fast, the remote just works and there is no buffering",pos
It was simply to set up and easy to use. Plug in sign in and bam,pos
"I refuse to buy cable, and I was using my computer to stream shows. This was interfering with my homework. I decided to try the stick out, but due to the upgrades they were out. I bought the box instead. I am so happy with my purchase. It doesn't overheat or get slow or have any of the problems the stock has.",pos
It was a gift to each of my children (3) for anniversaries/birthdays. They all love it for variety of movies and ease of setup and use. No complaints.,pos
What can I say I'm very happy with this fire tv go it mainly so I can use my Sony vue. It's very nice. This is my 3 one this year,pos
I bought this after already having a fire stick and this outperforms it.,pos
Good compared to other systems like Roku but really need to get an easy way to close apps running in background.,neg
Super fast response. Cool remote. Great menus and navigation,pos
Replaced an old blue ray cd player. Less space used and very fast response time.,pos
Streaming videos finding anything you want all the apps you need. I guess I don't need cable anymore,pos
I've had the stick but upgraded to the box for faster speed,pos
These are things are awesome. I have two now. I highly recommend this over the fire stick version. I have a fire stick that I only use when traveling.,pos
"The hardware is good, software isn't 100% operational all the time, i.e. PlayStation Vue has had issues quite often in the month I've had it, when it loads, it's great.",pos
"Bought to use with PS Vue, no issues so far. Would be nice to be able turn it off when not streaming.",pos
This product's reaction time between apps is what sold me. No lag like other devices. 4k streaming looks awesome!!,pos
Got this as a gift forMy son as he wanted to have Netflix in his room.,pos
Really loving the Fitbit Blaze so far. It reminds me to keep pushing and motivates me to stay active. The features are awesome and battery life is amazing. I definitely recommend this watch to someone looking to start being active/continue to be active/or push their limits. Great investment. FYI (it's a fitness watch not a pos smartwatch),pos
Really enjoy it . Would recommend it to others. Thanks,pos
Hard to argue with an amazon fire tv or stick. I bought this to replace my previous one that only did 1080p. Having had both I would say you won't go wrong with either. I bought the firetv for the direct Internet plug in capability which I figured would be a concern with wifi,pos
I love this! Easy to set up and easy to use. Would recommend it for sure.,pos
I would highly recommend this product!! I wish that I had purchased this item a long time ago!,pos
"This is a lot faster then the fire tv, I have both and love the fire tv because how much faster it is.",pos
"I've only had one box failure since I cut the cable cord years ago and Amazon stood by replacing it because it was an odd occurrence. I have several of these -- they work great not only with Amazon features, but with Hulu, Netflix and other streaming media options. I tried a Roku unit from a friend once and didn't like it. The Fire TV, on the other hand, is very easy to use.",pos
"This is much better product than the fire stick itself. I was able to connect it via wifi or via the Ethernet port. Fast easy and watching tv in less than 15 min out of the box! Also, you can download the remote to the fire tv for IOS. (Comes in handy when someone misplaced the remote)",pos
"We have a tv that already has Netflix and Amazon but still wanted all our other apps that you just can get on other devices. We love this this thing and highly recommend it just ask Alexa for stuff instantly you have music, movies, and shopping.",pos
Whether if you have cable or not (we don't)- this is an amazing device to have. Many movies to choose from.,pos
"I enjoy using this, it has a wonderful Ultra HD picture quality. I picked this version for use with Sling TV or Playstation Vue.",pos
I have to unplug it and wait 30 seconds every time,pos
Streams much better than smart tv does. Well worth it,pos
I bought the Amazon Fire TV to mod and stream media. It works fantastic and does exactly what I want including 4k video output. The primary reason I chose this item over the Fire stick was that I wanted wired ethernet and not wireless. Picture quality and sound is excellent.,pos
I got this for my mom who wanted to cut down on her cable bill. It has worked great!,pos
"I own all three of the latest Fire TV, Roku and Apple TV. Out of the three, as a pure streamer, I'd say Roku is probably my favorite followed by Apple TV and then Fire TV. However, as a multi-purpose device, the Fire TV wins hands down and it's not even close. The Fire TV allows you the most customization, freedom and versatility, such as the ability to side-load apps. Both Roku sand Apple TV are locked tight in that regard. Fire TV also features a more baked in Prime experience. The Fire TV can be a little slow sometimes and can freeze occasionally (more so depending on what you install), but overall, not a bad box for the price.",pos
able to access movies and TV--easy to use/easy to set up,pos
"I haven't used it a lot yet, but the few times I did, it works great. It was easy to set up. Looking forward to be able to bring this with us on trips.",pos
"Great product! Easy to use! ihave Sony Vue tv service, Netflix and Amazon prime. Using all of these with just 1 remote makes things easier.",pos
"So far, works just as it should. Haven't used it over WiFi, as I have it direct connected to my modem. I love that it came with a remote, but wish it could use a universal one, but the phone app works just ads well, too. Wish there was an off button, not just sleep mode.",pos
"Its amazing, super fast in response and will provide access to all your amazon content. If you are a prime member this is a must IMO!!",pos
"I purchased after owning a FireStick for a while, which is now moved to a different room. Works great so far and runs smoother than the stick.",pos
I wish I had purchased this a earlier. Fun for the whole family.,pos
"Compact, Fast, Reliable .... Very GoodI am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):",pos
I have several kindles and so this time I choose FireTV. It is good quality and it works as promise.,pos
4K Netflix streaming is awesome. Tons of available apps. Remote works well. Gets kinda hot after a while but doesn't seem to be affecting performance. Would recommend!,pos
I have 2 FireTV boxes and 2 Fire Sticks and love them both. The sticks buffer a bit sometimes but the box never does for us. I use it with Playstation Vue and it works great!,pos
Product does not disappoint. It does what it says.,pos
Amazon TV is a great streaming devise and it has voice control.The Fire TV also streams in 4k,pos
"This things is amazing. I had a Roku and a Matricom G box before it. It's fast, has expandable storage, usable USB ports, and you can easily side load Kodi. The only gripe I have is that there is no IR control, so you can't program it to a smart remote. I do like the fact they make an app for iOS and Android so that make it a bit better, but it would be nice to have one remote control I can use to control everything.",pos
I purchased this to watch Amazon Prime programing and Playstation Vue.This is way faster than the Fire Stick. Although I still have occasional glitches I can't for sure say its from the Fire TV versus the services.,pos
great product. I have 4 android fire TV boxes in my house. I love it. easy to setup,pos
"After reading many reviews on the other competitor products and even purchased another one that was much more expensive and complicated to install and operate, we decided on this one and could not be happier. Easy to install, operate, and has many features that we use daily. A big plus if you are an Amazon Prime member. Although the family uses this mostly for tv and movies, I use it mostly for listening to music. It is fast and we now have the unit on two tv's. We also gave one for Xmas.",pos
After a lot of research I purchased the fire tv. As far as t know it is one of the only if not only streamers out today that after its latest update can force dd+ to downcovert to regular dd 5.1 over HDMI great feature for soundbar and legacy receiver owners. I do not have a 4K tv so that is not important to me. All else works great out of the box this unit had a lot if bugs in the beginning but except for lack of vudu I love it. Being a prime member also helps.,pos
"This is really the best streaming device it has all the services like netflix, hulu, and it also plays games. I love this fire tv. Its also 4k.",pos
Very very fast and has 4K awesome video that most players don't have!,pos
"I LOVE THE AMAZON TV, THEY SHOULD CALL IT THE AMAZING TV BOX!!!",pos
"Love it, get lots of programs. This was referred to me by a friend of mine as highly recommended.",pos
"Not enough free programs. Even with a subscription to Netflix, etc. you still have to pay for most movies, shows.",pos
Best electronic purchase in a long time serves its perpose for streaming my shows and watching movies!,pos
"Works really good, highly recommended. Would definitely buy to a friend or family member.",pos
Love this product. Neat design and easy to navigate.,pos
Worked great! Looks good. Feels good. Smells good.,pos
I asked for a roku4 for Christmas but got Amazon Fire instead. I've never had either one but so far I really like Amazon Fire. I just wanted something faster than my DVD player that takes too long to update and this has been perfect.,pos
What a excellent strean=ming player and with the 4k resolution goes great with my Samsung 4k tv,pos
Love the new Amazon Fire TV. It is real fast and the thing I like best about it is that you now can put in a SD Memory card for a lot more space. Cheaper and better then the new Apple TV.,pos
In my honest opinion spend the extra money on the FireTV and directly connect it to your router. If you have Brighthouse internet then you'll understand why. Their hardware constantly has wifi issues. So much happier that this plugs directly into the router and my streaming is no longer interrupted.,pos
From the beginning we've had issues with our remote,pos
"at first view I was thinking too much to get or not get this product, but I tried and I love it... Amazon Video is the most amazing video library paying yearly and enjoy at home :) Love this product.",pos
"flips between Prime, Netflix, and Hulu quickly and easily & lot more",pos
This is a good product the resolution is clear and very pretty. Glad I bought it.,pos
"I bought this item for my boyfriend, he loves it he loved it so much he bought a few for Christmas gift thank you",pos
Fire tv works great and user friendly. Great for watching movies,pos
Bought it specifically for Sling TV and it streams Extremely well on all apps including Hulu and Netflix. It took the place of my PlayStation 3 for video streaming and has been a pleasant improvement with much less buffering and almost no load times .,pos
Amazon Fire Tv is a must if you have Amazon Prime.,pos
I love the picture quality from this device. Can't go wrong with a 4k . Also the picture steaming on the TV screen amazing. Good job amazon.,pos
This Fire TV works great for playing some games and streaming content. It's a plus that it's 4K enabled. Haven't really been able to use the 4K so can't comment on that,pos
"Much faster and stronger signal than Fire Stick, which I also love and is on my other TV.",pos
"purchased the fire tv and love it, saves me tons of $$ on my cable bill",pos
Great product love that you can sideload kodi app.,pos
If your looking for an upgrade from Roku or the fire stick this is it,pos
FireTV is as advertised. I like it better than the cable box and does not hog up to much internet bandwidth.,pos
Works as advertised. Will be interesting to see that additional apps that Amazon rolls out for the Fire device.,pos
This is a great device for your transition off cable. I recommend slingtv to help the transition. I have the firetv as well as the firestick. Spend the additional money for better wifi. You can also wire direct for best HD streaming. Netflix and Prime work well over wifi with 20 Mbps type speed. I just upgraded to 100 Mbps for better results. Also see Kodi app.,pos
Decent choices. Integrates Netflix and voice commands. Sometimes loses wifi connection and has to be reset.,pos
Good product for my family and gave gift to my fri,pos
I would not know where to start. It is the best among the the field of Android TV. Voice call is second to none. I have recommended it to more than 3 of my frieds.,pos
Good device4k video is niceGreat supportNegative point is doesn't have Browser and cach issue low space.,pos
"My kid love it, especially the sd card slot.Tgey can watch there favorite movies on the microsd.",pos
"Once you start to figure out all this will do , you will be very happy with your purchase",pos
great little box for streaming alot of media content.,pos
We were already a prime member so no extra cost for service,pos
"The firetv has a compact, sleek design, is easy to set up and also has the ability to configure using cat5 cable, which for my area is much faster than WIFI.",pos
"Fast and reliable, easy to use interface. Great price and fast service at Best Buy.",pos
Amazon fire tv is the best to use with kodi app that allows you to have all the movies without any additional charge.,pos
"This is the center of my home theater system. Plays music, movies and anything else you throw at it. Excellent!",pos
Box works faster than the stick as long as your router is close to the TV or Fire Box. Great Product!,pos
it works. does what its supposed to. looks good beside my black tv. and really good on my white mantle.,pos
I like u can add more memory it's faster then the 1st gen picture quality is even better,pos
Good product. Good speed. But freeze many time. Recommend a power on button on remort controll,pos
Very easy to set up and begin using. Live fire stuck and fire stick tv,pos
I love the how clear and fast streaming . Would highly recommend this item for steaming etc,pos
I give to my husband as a gift and he is very happy!,pos
Definitely the best streaming box in the market especially the new 4K version. I love this box better than Apple box.,pos
"I love all the apps on fire tv. The only negative is, it doesn't come with a hdmi cord.",pos
"This product is really great, not buffering when watching live streaming.",pos
It's a perfect gift and has way more than I expected it to have.,pos
Bought 2 of these and love them! First 1 was for me. 2nd one was for my daughter. Very slick interface and allows for super fast streaming. Easy to setup and easy to use. Probably will buy the gaming controller for both of them next.,pos
Needs more apps and has bugs that need fixing.....,pos
We all know how great this is. It's only a question of where to buy it. BB has the best price!,pos
We needed to upgrade to 4K and this made it available.,pos
This is the perfect starter media player for someone who is new to online media. Mom loves it,pos
"Found this product on sale, so I pulled the trigger and picked one up at my local Best Buy. The setup is as easy as plug n play. Comes preloaded with plenty of apps. I was able to connect my Bluetooth keyboard and mouse via the USB input in the back making browsing the Internet a breeze.",pos
This was on my son's wish list and it worked as he'd hoped. He was also able to add some apps to make this product even more versatile.Great Black Friday deal.,pos
I think this item is great. I got rid of my Cable.,pos
Great box for the money and it is so easy to use and enjoy,pos
"4 k capabilities, Ethernet direct hook up to router for faster streaming, voice remote control! Much better and not so restricted like Apple TV! A+++",pos
The best of the streaming boxes. I have used all of the major brands and like the Fire TV the best.,pos
Great product easy to use . Even my kids 8/10 can use it !,pos
Easy to setup and use!! Would recommend to anyone looking for a convenient way to add a Smart TV to their home!,pos
"This is a very wonderful streaming product. It is fast and has numerous app capabilities. There are some flaws though. The remote sometimes doesn't work then you'll have take out and put in the batteries, but you can use you're phone as a remote, it is faster and easier that way too. And it doesn't support VUDU or Crunchyroll. You can only real put this divice to its full potential if you're a Amazon prime member",pos
Great for streaming movies to your television. ...,pos
I own 3 firesticks for every tv in the house never had a problem with any of them . Wanted upgrade and saw some reviews online and I'm glad I got my hands on the firetv. With a faster processor expandable memory is just perfect for kodi the next. Big thing next to the nvidia shield which I own as well. I will definitely recommend it .,pos
"What a difference and got a super deal before Christmas. The new Kindle Fire not only does UHD with my monitor, the interface is really nice. I think it's much better than the Roku 3 I have been using and the Roku 4 that couldn't recognize my UHD HDMI port. It would only do 1080p. Plan to buy another to replace my Roku 3, for a 1080p TV. NICE!",pos
I had no cable but had internet so I thought this Amazon item would be good. Basically you have to pay for each subscription to use this making it super costly. I retuned this and just use Netflix with a wifi enabled tv.,neg
"I have used chromecast before; but heard a lot about its voice remote and other benefits. So, purchased this one. It is good; but i loved casting from my browser. It doesn't have default browser or in app store. probably I can install one using adb. Also, it is somehow slower than chromecast and takes a log time once it goes to sleep. I will recomend to someone only of someone knows adb and can add on apps.",pos
"I would recommend this to anybody who streams on line, or uses Kodi",pos
Works just as advertised. 4K streaming looks really good.,pos
I bought the Fire TV in able to watch Prime Videos. I have a Smart TV and an Apple TV. They all work about the same they each have their unique features features.,pos
a lot less buffering than the fire stick. this is almost as quick as my Nvidia shield. wish i could download android apps,pos
i bought this to replace a old apple tv works great,pos
If your student you're going to love Amazon TV. I'm a Amazon prime member because I buy books from Amazon all the time. With this box you can also have the benefits of streaming movies with your membership.,pos
Super fast streaming TV. Great content. Endless entertainment,pos
I really like this product. I can access the internet with the Fire TV and watch my shows via Netflix. It is also user friendly.,pos
I love the fact that this is so much faster than the Amazon stick. Wonderful product.,pos
"Amazon has made a very affordable upgrade. Fast streaming, a responsive remote control and easy to set up. Picture is crisp and HD all the way. Supports 4K so future upgrades are a forgone conclusion.",pos
"That's my only issue with it, vs the last one. But it was bought for a living room tv that does not use it so no biggie. Easy to install Kodi on. Just wish they would decode VC-1 files smoothly. Maybe the next gen?",pos
"So far this has been a great product. Very easy setup and the remote fits nicely in your hand, similar to Apple TV remote but larger",pos
This fireTV is the new 4k device. It allows you to sideload apps. It also now allows the sideloaded apps to have icons appear on the app menu. Amazing product. It has twice the memory as the fire stick. And it can be hard wired to your network. The stick is wifi only.,pos
"The device itself is good designed.I'm Amazon prime member, but found that the amazon prime video/tv isn't that good. Can't find many good video to watch.",pos
No words can explain what im viewing. I can now watch tv +more,pos
"Its Fast, reliable, what else could you ask for! This Bad boy will knock out the competition and get rid of your cable bill for good! Its time to Cut the cord people because Fire TV is the future of entertainment!",pos
Plugged it in and it found my network easily. My server is on the second floor and have no speed issues. Much faster than my Apple TV older version and the Roku 2 paper weight that was always my network problem....,pos
I like the flexibility and great responsiveness of the FireTV. Our family is able take advantage of the built in options (including Amazon Prime) and set it up just the way I like. I also have friends who prefer the Fire Stick. They have customized those and still have good performance. FireTV is great for anyone and even better if you are a little tech savvy..,pos
It's great and it works very well with 4k makes all the difference in the world.,pos
"easy to buy on line and store, fast shipping and pack out good",pos
good add thirt party app watch chinese tv.speed fast .and stady.,pos
"Works Great, Flixster is a little slow compared to vudu but at least I can still view my movies from vudu.",pos
Debated whether to purchase this or not. Recently cut the cable cord. We also subscribed to sling tv and already was Netflix subscriber. Love this option. My favorite is the music stations. Most have lyrics to the songs I enjoy through amazons fire tv.,pos
"I love my Amazon Fire TV. It's an amazing device! It's quick and very responsive. Overall, I believe it's the beat streaming device on the market!",pos
"As a video streaming device, the Fire TV is great, especially if you're a Prime member. It's more powerful than most media boxes on that market especially if you're into gaming, which is where that extra juice shines.In fact, tons of Android games play great on it. You don't even need the optional controller for most of them. And there's something to be said for playing Candy Crush on the big screen. But for more serious games like Grand Theft Auto, Tales from Borderlands, Modern Combat, or Knights of the Old Republic?Really well. You might want to invest in a controller for some of them (though not all game support the controller natively so do your research!) they run very smooth, and without any noticeable frame-rate drops. Though, most Android games don't really push the hardware anyway, so this should come as no surprise. But at the very least, this does mean you'll be able to play top-of-the-line Android games for several years with no problem. Some apps have their own versions specifically for the Fire TV, so you'll want to make sure to get those ones if available.You also may be wondering what the difference is between the 2015 model, and the previous 2014 launch model. Well...not much. The newer box is capable of a 4K output whereas the older version only went up to 1080p. But since most people don't even own 4K TVs, this feature probably won't be too useful. That said, it is nice future-proofing, as 4K TVs become more and more standard, the Fire TV will be ready. There are smaller changes here and there, but I'm not familiar enough with the older model to say what is what.Anyway, if you're looking for a streaming box that in addition to offering the usual Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and (of course) Amazon, also lets you play Android games (and play them well).It's worth noting that you can't access the Google Play store without rooting the system to install it first. Though, even then only a limited selection of Google Play apps is even compatible with the Fire TV (as of now) so it might not be worth the trouble, especially when Amazon usually offers comparable, if not the same exact apps anyhow. But it's worth pointing out all the same.",pos

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",pos

I use to have the Apple tv and I like the fire tv more due to the streaming and voice activation. I have just recently purchased this item but the streaming is quick and it is very easy to maneuver through the channels. I have told some of my clients about the fire tv over the Apple tv.,pos
Love the fire tv! It's is fast and very responsive. If you have Amazon prime this is a must!,pos
Got it on sale.might have to get rid of my cable company.,pos
"Ok so I tried the free trials for hulu, netflix and amazon. This device allows you to acess them all and many others. But don't expect much to be free. After your monthly free trial with amazon you have to pay for the whole year up front which equals to a little less then hulu or netflix monthly fee's. Amazon offers many movies for this deal but I noticed many movies like new releases and a lot of series are not free and the rent prices are higher then red box. This device is also better if you have cable already because you can link it to your regular cable feeds. It is a bit complex and you have to down load all kinds of things. But the device is made as good as an iphone maybe better I was impressed with the hardware and the boot speed, but be prepared to invest in more bandwidth to run this device smoothly. When I watch anything on it I make sure everything else that feeds from the modem is offline.",pos
I bought it as a Christmas gift and the person enjoys it.,pos
The processor and speed of this unit is unparalleled. As long as you have fast enough wifi (and a docsis modem) you will only get signal loss once in a great while; and it won't be the FireTv's fault. Love the plethora of apps available for various channels and the use of SlingTv with this box is a great option in place of cable/satellite.,pos
They advertise zero lag time. Does still need to buffer,pos
Great product built structurally solid no issue and purchased 2.,pos
I have so many different apps that I use to watch my movies and TV and this device groups them all. The remote makes searching a breeze and Alexa is entertaining to talk to. I would get multiple of these. Amazon is adding a LOT of great features to prime. Oh and I hope you have PRIME when you get this. If you dont your wasting money. Get prime and get the fire TV,pos
Great product. Easy to use and operate. Would recommend,pos
"I purchased this device because I had the stick and I loved it. I knew this one has a faster processor, it would handle third party software better. I enjoy this product, it's really fun to use.",pos
"Purchased the device when it is on sale, it is much better build than Matricom Gbox Q. Looking to buy another one when it is on sale.",pos
I love this and use it every night to watch just about anything I want.,pos
"Purchased for the TV in another room after cutting the cord. It's better than my Fire Stick, as this one comes with voice search and is ready for 4K. Best Buy has it on sale at $85, do recommend.",pos
"I bought this to replace my Fire TV Stick because the wifi in my house is terrible. I wanted something that I could plug an ethernet cable into and I am NOT disappointed! The speed on this device is incredible! Very fast interface and I get much less buffering now that it is plugged directly into my cable modem. I did have to upgrade my router and change out my CAT5 for CAT6 cables, but that is more likely due to the speed going to the Fire TV and not the product itself.",pos
If I purchased it at the sale price -- $25 cheaper -- I'd be giving it 5*. Amazon has a few kinks -- please focus on services I have setup -- but on the whole it's easy to find content.,pos
If you have an amazon prime account this is the item for you!,pos
Love this product will buy again this product is smooth and fast,pos
"So far this is the best, least expensive media player I have found that meets my needs. Every media player can stream Amazon, Netlfix, Hulu ... What sets this apart is since it uses Android, you can actually do stuff with it if you don't mind side-loading some stuff. In my case, I use it to run Kodi. Why? Well, Kodi can play dvd iso files. I have bought hundreds of exercise videos over the years, and need the iso in order to use the menus. With Kodi you can do this. The last media player at this price point that could do this was the WD TV Live. This is that, plus plus plus. Highly recommend.",pos
"I really like the voice control. It takes all the effort out of doing searches, without the annoying on screen keyboards.",pos
"I'm happy with the product, all works perfect, but the Best Buy employee attitude I don't like, I'm ask for the product and he told me if you don't see here we don't have it, and I ask another employee and he show me the item from another place, a very different attitude.Thank you !!",pos
"The controller and box are compact. The use of device is straight forward, but still requires a few days to become intuitive. There is a problem removing the battery cover, that allows replacement of batteries. It was immovable, and I finally had to use a pocket knife to pry it open, scaring the bottom of the controller. Amazon should have spotted the problem before going into production, accounting for the 4 star rating.",pos
We don't have cable tv so this is a great way to get to see shows and rent movies,pos
Love Amazon Fire TV. Easy and simple to use and set-up.,pos
I got it for my brother and he loved it! He loved how small the box is and how it doesn't take to much space.,pos
"Just like the reviews said, the Netflix app buffers every few minutes...AWFUL.....now I only have to glimpse that spinning red circle and my blood pressure rises. (I was hoping I would be one of the minority. =( ) . I finally yanked the HDMI cable and attached it to my computer to finish watching my program.I'm not returning the Amazon Fire-TV yet, because I recently acquired Amazon Prime and I've been hearing great things about their selection of movies, etc. Will update after I've used it for that.",neg
Got this for a Christmas Gift and they love all the things it does. No complaints yet,pos
"Great options, but could always have more. More apps!",pos
The product is easy to use and loads everything quickly. The voice command works great and the 4k picture looks fantastic,pos
Have a firestick and now a fire box and I am impressed with both products. The box however is a much more superior product. The speed is extremely noticeable and the expandable memory slots are a bonus. The ability to hardwire directly into my router makes for buffer free streaming. Well worth the extra money.,pos
"Got this mostly for watching Amazon content buy it works well as a game center for mobile apps too. Can't say enough good things about it--haven't got a UHDTV so can't comment on 4k.Lot of experience with Amazon products so setup and connecting were easy for me. Travels very easily -- small and lightweight. Ethernet cable works best, obviously, but I found hotel wifi pretty effective for streaming too.",pos
I really like it work great i recommended to my friends,pos
"Buy this Amazon box and side load Kodi - so you can get free tv , box office movies and more ... Google Kodi and watch a video",pos
"Had previously owned the fire tv stick to see how it would work, and i was impressed with everything it offered, so this full size Fire TV was just as good with faster internet (since it is now hardwired with ethernet cable) and has more memory. connecting was easy and everything was easy to scroll through. Having an amazon prime account gives you even more selections.",pos
This is a much better alternative to apple tv.you can do so much more with this powerful machine,pos
I have purchases 2 of the Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) - Black.,pos

Poor choice The product did not work after only one week it froze on me and I was unable to get it to go to the factory reset I would not recommend this product at this time I will call Amazon back to ask for my money and a refund after going on line I see that this is a common problem a problem that they should solve,neg
this was a Great product. i would recommend this..,pos
"Amazon is at the forefront of 4K content, offering several shows in HDR. Then why isn't their very own streaming player capable of displaying it? And at only 30 fps to boot. This was obviously built to a price but if you've already shelled out the money for a 4K TV wouldn't you want it to be able to display all that it's capable of? The Roku is, at present, the far superior product.",neg
"I bought this for one reason, and thats Kodi, its an awesome device for that, and with the sd card reader its easy to install and get up and running, highly recommended",pos
I bought this for my wife and she uses it every night before she goes to bed. She always watching Netflix or HBO go. Great investment.,pos
"Set up was easy. Plug it in, turn on the tv. Learning what channels I can see or not see is a learning curve. So far I am liking it but have to adjust to the changes moving away from cable.",pos
"Loving this little box. Great interface, and works well with Kodi, even though you have to jump through hoops to get it installed.",pos
"This works really well, no issues streaming. Would recommend.",pos
"I bought this device and put it in my new theater room. I love the games and streaming. I have yet to upgrade to 4K through Netflix, but I am excited to try it out on here when I do. I am just waiting for a bit more content.",pos
Great little streaming box. Better than the fire stick.,pos
"I've owned several of the Amazon devices (box and sticks), and love the new 4K box!",pos
What a buy. You can now get rid of cable and by this wonderful media streamer by Amazon. Very powerful and responsive.,pos
"Now I can get Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime, and a lot more. There is more there than I can watch! Great value! Very easy to setup and flawless operation. I do have a very fast internet so I have no problems whatsoever.",pos
Gift purchase for my son and family for Christmas.,pos
Great for streaming movies and music to your Smart TV!! Especially if you have Amazon Prime.,pos
I was worried at first but it works great and only con is that u have to unplug it from the tv it does get super hot,pos
"Pick the fire tv over the Apple and we are glad we did. We didn't even realize how many free apps and shows you can watch without being a prime member. Great buy, I wish we had bought one a lot sooner and dropped cable.",pos
"Not user friendly. Sluggish, confusing, and extremely frustrating. Returned the item.",neg
Does just what it says. Easy to set up and use. Great alternative to cable.,pos
"I love it. So easy to set up, couldnt believe how fast it is.",pos
This box is works great all the apps work and are responsive with little to no lag. For 99 bucks it's a great deal I barely watch cable anymore because you can access tv shows on every network from the most recent to the first episode. I use this every single night since buying it and have had no problems with it at all,pos
The fire tv is great for those who have amazon prime and Netflix as it allows you to view thief 4K content that is included,pos
I went back and forth but this was the right call.,pos
"We upgraded to the 4K version. It has better buffering, and we love the voice search capabilities on the remote. It is super simple to set up and start watching your favorite programs. It also let's you add external apps like Kodi. Well worth the money.",pos
"Great apps!, Works great playing amazon movies! Very happy!",pos
"I purchased it to see if the stream speed would be quicker than my Amazon Firestick but was disappointed.The stream speed is at the mercy of your internet provider.The processing speed is faster than the Firestick but in the end it has the same memory as the Firestick.For the price, the Amazon Firestick is better if all you do is stream... It might be a good fit for gamers.",neg
Lots of great features and voice recognition is great!,pos
I tried my new Amazon Fire TV box. Worked as advertised.,pos
excellent graphic quality easy to use. does not use infra-red so other remotes will not work with it.,pos
HW and wireless handled 1080p and 4K content with no issue. Love this thing,pos
Upgraded to voice controlled remot from the original fire tv. Love it. Don't think I even need to keep cable!!,pos
bought this device for my living room tv set up best idea ever,pos
"Out of all thats offered out there, this is my favorite. It helps if you're a Prime member, and Kodi runs well on this device.",pos
"Got rid of my Apple TV because it didn't have Amazon Prime. Love the fact that you can get Netflix, Pandora, and Amazon Prime on one device.",pos
Excellent purchase and easy to set up. Great entertainment console.,pos
"This device is easy to set up. Paired with wireless router, and loads video content quickly.",pos
Love these firesticks its a very good device love the selection of movies.,pos
Faster than the Fire stick and worth the extra money.,pos
For the price Amazon tv is the best everything that I watch on it comes in 4K . I definitely recommend this product.,pos
These is so much this unit can do......I do recommend this one over the fire stick (I have both) only because of the buffering issues. Didn't really notice a difference between the wifi and Ethernet cord plugged in,pos
I love this amazon fire tv! I use it all the time. The picture is crisp and the device is super fast!,pos
"The ultra UD, the easy user interface, well designed remote and the ability to add third party apps makes this a must have!!",pos
You can do a lot with this box to set it up for free movies if you know anything about computers.,pos
Would not recommend to anybody I had to take it back three times and still would not hook up to TVs very poor customer service,neg
Makes any tv a smart tv! Lightning fast 4 gig processor.,pos
"So far, so good! It's been about 3 weeks or longer since i got it. I use it more than i thought I would. A good reason to justify the $100 for the Amazon Prime Subscription.",pos
"Purchased the amazon fire to gain access to streaming such as amazon prime video. The device was simple to setup and is nice and sleek. I have had the device for about a month now and have had zero issues with it. Also, i purchased this at bestbuy and about a week later it went on sale at amazon. Bestbuy priced matched the sale price and credited my card. Good customer service.",pos
This little box should be call a happy box. Once you have sat it up all you have to do is say what you want and it pop up on your tv.,pos
Well worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account. Easy set up....excellent streaming quality. My only complaint is that I wish the speech search feature (there is a speech recognition search feature) worked with other apps.,pos
"Store salesman recommended the Fire over ROKU which I had history with. Stated that you get more with FIRE. What I find is that they are very different in how they actually operate. ROKU is more user friendly while the FIRE is more tech savvy and can be open sourced to some degree. One is good for very computer knowledgeable on how to manipulate software and the other ""ROKU"" is better at a user friendly interface that is more preditable.",pos
"Love these, great cable cutter. A little glitchy on the remote but really good product",pos
Navigates easily. Many channels. Fast connection speeds.,pos
Surprised how powerful this little thing is. Easy to use and setup was a breeze.,pos
Amazon FireTV is a great product. I buy a bunch of them for friends and family because they are the way of the future for streaming devices.,pos
"I had purchased the fire stick,but then decided to upgrade to the fire TV for more memory space and faster wifi.",pos
"Upgraded to this from the Fire TV Stick, it's twice as powerful than the stick. I liked it a lot and got 3 of my coworkers on them and they love it. Great for travel, a dorm room & for not paying on extra cable/satellite boxes and their monthly vig.",pos
"This is my second Amazon Fire TV product, first I had the Fire TV stick which was great but a little under-power so I went ahead and upgraded to the Fire TV box and I have to say that this box is great. The streaming picture is gorgeous!! I am using it hard wired so I can't talk about the Wifi, but the videos load basically instantly and it never looks pixelated. I installed Kodi and it works great!!, Alexa is very handy and can even do shopping lists for you. The only thing that I don't like is that the search feature on the box it only gives you results from the Amazon Video store, it doesn't give you results from Netflix, Hulu or others. It has a MicroSD card slot which is very handy if you are planning to download a lot of games, the remote works great and comes with batteries. Overall is a great box and if you have an Amazon Prime subscription is definitely a must!! You won't find a better and more organized Amazon instant video app.",pos

"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited .

Amazon fire adds a new dimension to tv watching. So much easier to use than other remotes.,pos
love it best purchase so far this year better than the wifi fire stick,pos
Great device for the price. Small enough to hide it and quiet enough to forget about it. 4K is the great addition that's on it. Compared to Apple TV you get more storage space for less on this and you get 4K too.,pos
"The Amazon Fire Stick is a great way to access the vast library of Amazon and other content in any tv. You'll need an HDMI input on the television, a power outlet and reliable wi-fi. Get one for every TV in your house.",pos
Now I have fire tv in all my room is. A great product you can do a lot of thing,pos
I purchased this to watch movies and such on a led tv that doesn't have smart features built in and because of the ability to side load apps. Just an added bonus you can pair bluetooth headphones to the fire tv but not the stick,pos
worth it to spend the extra 50 dollars and get the box w game control,pos
Very pleased with the fire tv. Works faster than the fire stick. More bang for the dollar.,pos
"I like how it works. It works well, I just don't like having to pay for everything.",pos
This is one of the best purchases i have ever made,pos
"I bought this for my son, and I'm going to buy myself one because I keep using his.",pos
I was not satisfied with Chromecast because of its limited abilities. Fire TV with sideloaded apps can do so much more. Love it!,pos
"Amazing! Easy to install and set-up. Voice control works well and controller fits easily in hand with the buttons in the right place. Got the first one for my wife at Christmas, we now own 4. Had 2 of the original Apple TV with small limited controller. That was painful. Amazon TV Is well worth the money!",pos
I am also dealing with Centurylink at 30 speed. I am considering Time Warner at 15. This I am told will eliminate any streaming problems due to internet speed.,pos
"Works good, easy to install and would definitely recommend",pos
I have purchased a few of these items they are perfect for getting rid of tv,pos
"I went with the Amazon Fire TV due to its flexibility to sideload Android apps but also be more forgiving than the regular Android builds. If you have Amazon Prime, this is the only way to watch it on an Android box. I wish Amazon would update its apps as quickly as the Google Play store does but overall, I have no real complaints.",pos
Love it. Works great. Need good wifi signal. Easy to set up.,pos
"It's basically adding ""smart tv"" to my ""dumb"" tv! A lot of free movies to choose from, some rentals seem rather high, but no biggy because there a lot of options out there for that. Love the lyrics that play with the music!!",pos
"Works faster than the Blu ray Dvd/streaming combo like Sony or Samsung those were very slow streaming devices. I'm only on 3MBPS & the amazon Fire is a solid steaming device. I use Amazon video, Netflix, Pureflix,YouTube I've also seen a live event that streamed really good. Very impressed compared to the blu ray combo but it has its place but not for streaming anymore. Well done amazon and thanks to Best Buy .",pos
"Hulu, Netflix and more on this device. Ethernet cord from router straight to the firetv device is 10x better than connecting wireless",pos
"Works great. Easy to set up, watch youtube.com for it. Some streams better quality than others.",pos
Very good treating device be able to installed third party apps,pos
The Amazon Fire TV box is a wonderful device. I love the Alexa voice search feature. Wish there were more movie options for Amazon Prime members.,pos
"Many of my friends raved about how well the Fite Tv performed and after months of hearing great things about it, I have to say this has been one of the best investments.",pos
"Very easy to setup, internet reception is good using wired connection, 4K capable but 1080P is satisfactory.",pos
"Could not say more great things about this product!!! Do yourself a favor and get this! It's so fast and while it has the same functionality as the Firesticks which I also own, you can hook this up directly to your internet router which makes streaming extremely fast!!! Make sure you watch plenty of YouTube videos and anyone can figure out how to get the MOST ;) out of all of the services Fire TV, the World Wide Web, and KODI (YouTube this) has to offer!!!!",pos
Like responsive of the remote control. Great picture quality output (4K). Amazon prime has great video selection.,pos
Good product and will definitely share to all my friends,pos
I needed something that will easily connect to hotel WIFI cause I travel a lot so researched all devices and saw that the Amazon Fire was meant to connect to hotel WIFI with ease and I must that this device lives up to what it says it hooks up with to the hotel wifi with no problems great picture and fast steaming and I now use this at home as well I love it.,pos
Enjoy using this as much if not more than the Apple TV,pos
I am very happy with this purchase. It was super easy to set up. I especially love the voice control!,pos
I brought the fire tv to get rid of cable. I'm able to watch all my favorite movies and tv shows.,pos
"I'm on a year's assignment in LA. I've had Amazon Prime for years, but now it's essential to keep track of my programming.",pos
"I have used the Fire TV for a day, and I think that it is an enormous leap forward in set top box functionality.",pos
"I already had an Amazon firestick, I really love this device because it operates faster than my firestick and I'm able to plug an Ethernet cord. Great buy!",pos
great for movies.Works better with a bluetooth mouse,pos
Just what I was looking for! Family love it! Will buy it again!,pos
"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV after owning the Roku 3 for a year and after trying both the older and the newest versions and Apple TV. I am a Prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice. However, the remote is very unresponsive, disconnecting more than it stays connected. The menu layout is very ""ad-centric"" and pushes you towards how Amazon wants you to view their service. When the remote works, the Amazon TV seems sluggish in comparison to the other products I tried. After several hours of fighting with the remote, I decided to return it and get another Roku...possibly the version 4. Good try Amazon, but far from being close to either Roku or Apple TV.",neg
"After using the amazon fire tv for about two months, I can say that this is an excellent streaming device. I connected the fire TV to through the Yamaha receiver to my TV, therefore I get a perfect 5.1 sound. Amazon service is acceptable except the fact that they kind of force you to buy different subscriptions or buy movies if you want to watch the new stuff on the market. But here is the good news, you can use the device even without an amazon subscription - with Netflix, PBS, and so many other downloadable applications. With an 128 GB USB flash drive formatted in FAT32, this device may become an ideal player connected to your TV",pos
I have bought this item because I was previously using the firestick and I was happy with those but the streaming would buffer a bit more than I'd like. So a friend of mine recommend it to me sand said little to almost no buffering. And it's exactly that little to no buffering. Even when streaming from my iPhone it's an amazing device. I really like it,pos
"I really like the fire tv box. This was recommended to me by an Amazon sales rep stocking the store. My favorite part about it is that it plays 4K uhd video! Very fast and smooth, and actually takes advantage of the AC side of these new routers! Much better than using the apps built in to the tv!",pos
Decided to go with the Fire TV because of wireless issues and couldn't be happier.,pos
I have used different streaming android boxes and Apple TV over the years. Love this one. Starts up super fast and remote is very responsive. I mainly purchased it to use it with Kodi but I like how easy you can browse Amazon prime videos. I recommended it to a few friends and family. They all love it.,pos
It's great since you can plug into an rj45 connector it's much faster than the fire stick,pos
If you have amazon prime this is simply another way gaining more content If you are a cable cutter.. There's also the added plus of adding xbmc and getting additional content for content free.,pos
"If you're an Amazon Prime member and are looking for an easy streaming box for the whole family to use, this is it. The lack of a few apps is a bit disappointing but Amazon is expanding their library as time goes on, so be patient.",pos
"One of my best purchases yet...I have always been an apple person(still am), but this tv box is great. You can do so much with it. I just ordered a gaming controller for this unit. I have amazon prime and can watch so many tv shows and movies as well as listen to music. Great all around unit.",pos
This item is great! We have an apple TV for our other TV in our house but this item blows it out of the water. the ability to access so many additional things and apps is exactly what we needed. Plus being able to access the Amazon Prime music options and TV/Movie rentals makes it so we do not need to run to RedBox any longer.,pos
"I purchased this instead of the fire stick to pair with my new 4K tv. Easy to use, huge selection, small sleek design blends in to my entertainment system.",pos
"sadly it's lacking youtube, it does do everything else do and does it all great.go here for easy kodi setuphttps://github.com/sphinx02/FireStarter/wiki/Install-FireStarter-and-Kodi-%28only-FireTV-needed%29",pos
"Had an Apple TV, but as an Amazon Premiere member was missing out on a lot of free stuff. This is easy to navigate and filled in the gap.",pos
"I love it, easy to learn and operate. Quick response and easy to hook up.",pos
"I've had this for about a month and so far, it's all good. The remote that I can speak into is cool and most of what I say is recognized correctly by Alexa. I like that I can place Amazon orders this way if I feel the need. The only con, as of now, is that the battery cover is hard as h&ll to get off.",pos
Works well and does what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it.,pos
"I love my firestick, but the box is so much better",pos
I recommend it Amazon-Fire This product is excellent ...,pos
"I had the Fire Stick, ran OK did what I need to do but was slow, then I got this and it runs like a champ. plus a big factor why I wanted this was to Ethernet Port.",pos
if you don't already have a smart tv -this is the way to go - Amazon has so many more choices than Netflix plus Prime gets you free shipping on top of free movies,pos
This product is great! It allows me to watch whatever I want to watch from old TV shows to movies in the theater. I love this product.,pos
I like that you can access thousands of movies or tv shows. Just make sure you have enough speed on your router.,pos

I really like it because i can watch a lot of movies,pos
I've purchased several for family members and everyone is loving all the content available. Easy purchase may be back for more!!,pos
"It's ok, I didn't know that I would have to pay for movies",pos
If you want to cut the cable and go from your cable plan to a much more common sense one utilize this magical little box. Not only can it be loaded up with the standard TV apps it also makes a pretty great gaming system.,pos
"I purchased this two weeks ago and we have watched it every night. It is extremely fast, has 4k content and has a nice voice remote",pos
"Has everything you need... Movies, Tv, apps and game's in a nice interface",pos
"We use this to run Kodi. It works perfectly. Far better than the Fire Stick, which we also have.",pos
Best investment I made. Will buy one for every tv in my house,pos
"Bought one of these to get something to try out Kodi, as a streaming media device it works really well. I love the fact you can have your Netflix and other apps right at hand, I can still run plex and Kodi installs In a matter of minutes. Nice to have a single device to run all my needs and totally replaced the need for cable. The sticks work well but the extra grunt of this is worth the additional spend.",pos
The wide wide world of TV at your finger tips! We love this!,pos
Great product would recommend to anyone. Works great.,pos
"It is high recomend for everyone, it is fast and afforable player.",pos
"I love this device. User friendly, excellent performance. Way faster than stick version. And not limited like the Apple. I enjoy it!",pos
"Easy to install, get up and running. Easy to use. Works great",pos
"works great , and its a lot faster then my smart tv to access programs",pos
This works just as advertised. Wonderful to use this in an another room.,pos
"Overall the Amazon Fire is easy to use. I would recommend this device. Also, Best Buy has the best warranty policy!",pos
Very nice good product and the picture quality are very nice,pos
Not much of a selection for shows or movies. Hopefully changes,neg
Good buy! This is the best streaming device out in the market today.. Its really worth every penny,pos
If you know anything about the android OS and what you can run on it this is the device for you!!,pos
I wanted to cut the cord from satellite tv and search for a lower cost alternative. I LOVE the Amazon Fire TV. Easy to set up. Only disappointment is I can't watch all of the same programs/channels I did on satellite TV. I am saving $120/mo since I cut the cord!!,pos
love the fire tv.. super fast uploads. Small and compact,pos
"Unit is nifty for some functions, it would be good with a prime membership. I expect a little more usable content without additional purchase for the price tag. Still have not fully explored the unit.",pos
the concept is great! We have had some issues with certain streams being unplayable and it is sometimes difficult to find what you are looking for. There needs to be an easier way to maneuver and find the things you want to watch.,pos
"I just bought a 4K tv so I wanted to make certain that I obtained a media player that delivered 4K content. I looked that the Roku, Apple TV, but I settled on the Amazon Fire TV because of my previous Amazon account and the price point. The device is quite elegant with a small form factor. The remote is equally small and minimal in form but quite effective. The mic works great to interact with Alexa. Just for fun, I found it interesting that Alexa will answer a question comparing it to Siri, but Siri does not reciprocate.I like that Amazon has deals to allow HBO GO streaming on it, whereas my Sony TV was not allowed to thanks to some deal between Comcast Xfinity and the networks. Other apps such as Youtube and Sling also work just fine on the app. It also syncs up to your Amazon account and on some songs, lyrics will appear on the screen like some sort of karaoke service. I thought that was a nice feature.I wish there were a few more options on it to customize loadout or app management. Also, at times the device would disconnect from my N network and connect to the G band for some reason, forcing me to manually reset it. I wish it would automatically connect to the higher band, but it's a minor complaint. The bottom of the remote can scratch easily as well, so don't slide it across the coffee table as I am apt to do.Overall, this is a great product and I have no regrets purchasing it.",pos
"Great Streaming and very smooth. I haven't had it lagging yet,",pos
Once I figure out all the options I will be able to save money on my cable bill! It offers many channels and movies. Plus you are able to sign up for subscription channels as well. The downside is that it is only on one tv or maybe I just haven't read enough yet!,pos
Very easy to use and fast. Menu is set up in a user friendly way.,pos
I will save enough on reduced cable bills in two months to pay for my Amazon Fire TV,pos
Love my fire tv. I brought a sock earlier but this more stable and quick. Definitely would buy again.,pos

You can find thousands of movies and your favorite shows,pos
"4K, quad core, 4GB ram, USB and MicroSD, voice remote...this box is a monster. Bonus if you are part of the Amazon Prime world...if not, still get one, it runs circles around AppleTV. Plus, these can be modded, if you are savvy enough.",pos
"The 4K model exceeded my expectations as far as a streaming media player for the home entertainment system. It is easy to use even for a beginner. I like the voice command remote feature which eliminates a lot of button pressing. There are a lot of apps availabe and it integrates with Amazon prime customers. Overall, I highly recommend this box to those who like to spend a lot of time in front of their tv.",pos
works very well.. i was able to sideload kodi and along with amazon video and netflix fulfills all of my streaming needs.,pos
I would recommend this streaming device for anyone trying to cut cords and save money.,pos
"Great shows, fabulous quality, highly recommended, good price.",pos
"Its a little expensive but is a good Product, I will recommend this one over the Amazon TV stick",pos
"Wow says a lot. We are already prime members and love the normal benefits, but this box added to the list offering a huge selection of things to watch.",pos
"I had previously purchased the Amazon Fire TV Stick, which worked OK, but was lacking in some areas. I upgraded to the full-blown Amazon Fire TV mainly because of the faster Wi-Fi that is included. It makes a substantial difference when streaming HD content. Additionally, this unit has a faster processor and more memory than the Fire TV Stick. To me it is well worth the extra $$.",pos
I had the fire stick before buying this and though I liked the fire stick i thought it could be faster. The fire tv definitely bumps up the performance a bit and having the voice search really helps a lot and makes it better.,pos
"I have been and Apple TV guy from the start but was disappointed they chose not to include 4K on there latest model. So I thought I would see what Amazon had to offer. Wow the 4K content available is awesome and growing everyday. All the menu's are easy to use and set up. Very, very, happy with this purchase.",pos
"The device itself is funtional and gives you access to many types of services ex: netflix, hulu, amazon prime, and much more. It also allows you to customize it by side loading programs. Its not a bad little device but I prefer its big brother the amazon fire tv.",pos
This box let's anyone watch TV shows and movies. If you have amazon prime movies are free. Love it.,pos
"Turns any tv with hdmi into a smart tv, great apps",pos
Wanted to replace my fire stick and it was on sale,pos
"Works well when it works...sometimes it seem not to want to ""wake"" up",pos
Amazon fire TV is so easy to use and its a great way to watch everything you want,pos
Great features. We use it in the spare room and sometimes move it to the livingroom . I love it,pos
"Good job Amazon great product easy to hook up and start watching movies, sports etc.",pos
"Bought this for a bedroom TV. The interface is geared toward Amazon Prime members, so most of the items on the main screen are of no use to me. You must do some scrolling to get to the APPS page. So for people who aren't Prime members it's not as convenient as other streaming devices. My solution was to install Firestarter.I would have bought a Roku, but Amazon Fire is the only streaming device to support the TIVO app. So unless I wanted to spend quite a bit more for a Tivo Mini + Roku, this was my only choice. But after installing Firestarter, I'm satisfied. The Tivo app does not do everything a Tivo Mini does, it just allows us to watch recordings from our Tivo Bolt in the living room.Had it come stock with a display option to switch to a less prime-specific startup screen, i would have given it 5 stars. But Amazon is trying to promote Prime, so that's not going to happen.",pos
Apps and streaming run great. Searching and growing movie and show selection could use some tweets.,pos
Seems to work even better and faster than the fire tv stick.,pos
"This version has some advantages and upgrades compared to the previous version, but it is missing the optical audio out. Outside of that the device works fine, just not a fan of Amazon's version of Android. Still a good deal for what it is.",pos
Good productThe only thing I don't like is that the remote is unresponsive some times. All in all good steaming device.,pos
"I have always wanted to get the best products for the money for my audio video experience. The Amazon Fire for 4K has not disappointed. It was exceptionally easy to set up and attach to the internet and my TV. The updates for the Fire are seemless and fast. The visual quality is what was expected. If you already own the Fire would I recommend the upgrade? Do not know, but wish there was some sort of buyback program and then the choice would be easier. I do like the gaming ability of the system but have yet to explore those options extensively.",pos

"Amazon Fire TV is a great media streaming device. I made the decision to cut the cable when Sling TV started providing the ESPN family of channels on its app. But the question was: which device to get. I was already an Amazon Prime member and had a Netflix subscription. So I needed to find a device that had those apps, plus Sling and Hulu. Amazon Fire TV and Roku 3 were the only devices to carry all the apps that I was using and wanted to use. I read many reviews and both devices seemed to be good. So I rolled the dice and got the Amazon Fire TV. It was super easy to connect to my TV and Home Network. I was up and running in under 5 minutes. Haven't missed cable tv for a single minute. I like Amazon Fire TV so much that I got a 2nd unit for another television in the house. With a good HD antenna and streaming media device, you will never miss cable! Best of all, I am now saving over $100/month.",pos
It works pretty goodwork properly with the right Internet speed,pos
This product has surpassed all of my expectations for these add on tv devices. I originally had a Roku and I have to say this is 10 times better. You won't regret purchasing it.,pos
I had bought one for my bedroom back in december of 2015 and bought another one for my living room. I am a cord cutter and have zero complaints about this product. I have amazon prime as well so that adds even more to the amount of shows I can watch. Love it!,pos
"I had the first generation FireTV and it was great. I wanted something that was a little faster for playing games and also for using with Plex. Plex works so much better on this generation than the first. More of the videos that I have can be played direct instead of being transcoded. Games also seem much smoother on this device than the first generation but it is hard to tell due to the limited types of games on the Amazon App store. If you are looking for a device that can stream Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Amazon Prime Video, and ESPN and still be used for casual gaming then this is the device for you.",pos
Nice amazon fire tv ... Super quad core processor good box to see apps,pos
Device is smooth running and streams content seamlessly. More advanced settings and GUI smoothing is needed. Runs KODI extremely well.,pos
Very happy with my purchase. Streams everything I need it too with no hesitation.,pos
The amazon Fire tv is the best of all streaming devices a must have for Netflix,pos
This works as described and Am very happy with it.,pos
The Fire TV is a really nice box for streaming. Turns your TV viewing into a whole new experience.,pos
"I know there are other options out there, including the Fire Stick but this box is great. Doesn't lag at all, unlike my Apple TV (last generation though). I wanted to have a product based on Android for the goodies available and so far I'm liking it a lot, and it's 4K :)",pos
This Amazon Fire TV controller was a cinch to sync up with my TV. Kids love to use it to play games. I love it to surf around all the available content. Get this controller!!,pos
Very little buffering. Easy to use. Worth the extra money if you get a lot of buffering when trying to stream.,pos

"Up until now I had been using different android boxes to stream movies.I had read that the Fire Tv is very quick and capable of 4k, which is better than the expensive apple tv. Super easy to set up and boots lightening fast. Easy to sideload apps such as Kodi. I bought one for myself and another for my daughter. We all love it. The remote control is very responsive and voice search is awesome.",pos
Plugged it directly into my router for a faster connection and it works great,pos
I have two smart TV's. I use Fire TV more because it streams better and more reliably than the TV's.,pos
"So long cable, well worth it. All you need plus more.",pos
I have been using the Amazon fire tv stick. Getting the box is so much smoother.,pos
I love my Fire TV and has allowed me to cut all chords with any TV service providers.,pos
Bought this primarily to side load Kodi on it for viewing on my new 4k Samsung. Makes an excellent platform for what I use it for. Also enjoy the voice activation of music depending on what I'm in the mood for. No more Pandora!,pos
Really enjoy the selection of choices fro movies and TV show programs. Being able to view a season at your on pace.,pos
"When the unit is working, it's everything that you would want. However, the unit needs to be reset often as it will not turn on with the remote. Once you unplug it and plug it back in, it works fine.",pos
There is so many things you can do with this box. Its so entertaining.,pos
Use my amazon fire tv everyday for everything tv shows and movies listen to music and play games,pos
I really like this product. I love all the apps. I love the Alexa feature that works with the remote. There are options to mod this as well to do more. Better than an Apple TV. Similar to a Roku.,pos
"If you have amazon prime membership, I would suggest this device, also not, the remote has access to alexa, so there is more possibilities for using it with smart home devices",pos
"Love the variety of programs, apps, etc. It was very easy to set up and start using.",pos
I had the fire tv stick first and was told the fire tv was better so I knew I had to have one. I honestly haven't watched a lot of fire tv yet but I plan on it and I love the picture quality and the fact that I can watch movies on prime and all of that.,pos
I originally had a firestick and it worked okay. Upgraded to the box and it is much faster and no lag. Definitely buy a keyboard to go with it.,pos
My family and I love our Amazon Fire TV it is much faster than our Apple TV and with Amazon Prime there are a ton of free shows and movies to watch,pos
Love the Item. Im completely satisfied with my buy.,pos
The 2015 Amazon Fire TV is the better media streamer for this price. Fast processing and great image resolution when used as a open source media player. Highly recommend.,pos
This is one of my best buys for the year so far. Fire tv is super fast and love that you can hard wire it to the Internet. So much can be done with it aside from watching tv and movies which is a huge plus in itself. Love this thing.,pos
"The Fire TV has been a great addition to my home theater. It has a polished interface, and quality feeling remote. I especially appreciate the fact that there's an ethernet port included on the Fire TV. Overall, I have been very satisfied with the Fire TV.",pos
Excellent product. Zipper than the Fire Stick. Attractive design.,pos
Great device was able to side load apps cause the system is android based.,pos
So good I bought 2 of them. Super fast and tons of movies to choose from,pos
Fast processor to run my kodi. I love it. I only use it for that.,pos
"Works great after I learned how to maneuver through the numerous software components. Once I became familiar with using the Amazon Black box, I can now donate my old movies to numerous charities (tax time).",pos
"I'm very happy that I purchased the Amazon tv with voice remote. I was spending $108 a month, so I'm looking forward to the savings!",pos
"I love apple products but I'm a jailbreaker and unfortunately you can't jb the latest apple tv but amazon made things so much easier with the fire tv,especially when you can add more memory!",pos
A great streaming device that I use on a daily basis.,pos
I like the box much better than the stick. It has more memory along with optical out for surround sound etc. Voice activated remote and just overall smoother. Definitely worth the money to upgrade to the box over the stick.,pos
Really love this product it's fast portable and we can stream all our favorite shows.,pos
This Firebox is simple to install and use. Went for the box opposed to the stick for the faster processing option. Remember your electronics are only as fast as your internet!,pos
It's the faster modem I ever have now my computer not going down. Also I bought a amazonfire tv nice for the prize thanks.,pos
I now have. 5 of these. You need to get one asap. I'm a huge fan of the slingbox app and the prime features.,pos
I mainly got this united to task advance of Spotify Connect but the unit would lockup if I tablet or phone that I using times out. I have to reboot the device in-order for spotify to recognize the Fire device again.,neg
Is a good choice and product just need more channels,pos
I enjoy the access to alot of the apps. Wish there were more sports apps though,pos
"40x better than a Roku box, easy setup, nice guide,",pos
fire TV has everything anyone would need for their digital entertainment. It's easy to set up and easy-to-use,pos
"This is much better than the fire tv, but also a little bit more expensive. It's worth it.",pos
After setting up the Amazon Fire it froze on me and I had to return it !,neg
comes with tons of stuff and you can download a ton more best money I've spent in a while,pos
"I bought this because we wanted to ""Cut the Cord"" and not having any real knowledge of how these things worked, i bought this and played with it for a while and now i could not live without it. The only limitations i have found are the companies (Networks) that do not have apps. I would recommend this to anyone looking to ""Cut the Cord"".",pos
Purchased the Amazon fire tv when it went on sale for 85 bucks and i am very happy with this purchase. This will surely replace cable tv in the not so distant future.,pos
I wasn't sure about buying this product. Until I saw all of the amazing things it could do. A family member showed me and I was amazed.,pos
Now that playstation vue went nationwide I wanted something something for live tv to replace my ps3. I am now able to watch cable tv and ota(through an hdhomerrun) with no rental fees. The picture quality is great and has a great app selection.,pos

"I had bought a 4K TV and wanted to view some 4k content so got this. I found some 4K demos on Youtube and I was amazed at how good the picture quality was. In addition to watching Prime videos, I also watch SlingTV which seemed to work fine during the little time I used it. Setup was simple and it was up and running in no time.",pos
Happy with purchase would recommend! Always happy !,pos
I've bought MXIII Andriod box and Ouya but the Amazon Fire TV box is far superior than those! I love the ease of adding the KODI app. Just google how to install it on this Amazon box and it was quite simple. Even has a step by step you-tube video.,pos
"This is the best little affordable Android device around. Could use more memory, but love what it can do. The regular Amazon apps are just the beginning! Tons more you can do with it if you know what you're doing!",pos
The beginning of the end for paid cable!!! Got the Kodi jail break and can get any series on tv new episodes the very next day!!! Just awesome!,pos
This is an easy to use box. Voice control is a nice bonus!,pos
The Amazon fire TV has been a joy to own. It has a very simple to use interface. I also love the fact that it is always ready in the background a simple push of a button and it wakes and it's right where you left off. In my eye it's worth every penny I paid for it.,pos
Great over the top device. The Alexa integration is a major plus.,pos
Works great. Faster than fire stick and supports sub keyboard haven't figured out how to configure keyboard for Bluetooth.,pos
I would have given 5 stars but my unit refuses to wake up when I hit button on remote. I have to pull the plug to power unit up. Hopefully Amazon will resolve this issue.,pos
"All the apps you need and they keep adding more , and now with the Amazon echo Alexa you can control your smart devices by saying "" Alexa turn on my lights , or TV or Shades or music or locks I mean it's endless even my Sonos. Get this thing , Apple or Chrome can't touch this at all.",pos
I love amazon fire tv the shows a great and the movies are outstanding. Good job Amazon,pos
So far the best streaming box out there you can easily download third party apps and run Kodi etc... Can't beat it,pos
"Bought this for access to Amazon programming and I'm liking it better than my Apple TV. I don't have the newest Apple TV, so I can't comment on that product, but this one is fast and has a couple of key buttons on the remote that make navigating easier than my apple. I also love the 4K content streaming perfectly!",pos
Love all the apps available more than any other streaming Device by far with 4K content .,pos
"Got this vs the fire stick because of the wired connection, voice command remote, and netflix in 4K. It was a hands down, no brainer; it does what I need!",pos
"I have a smart tv, but Netflix and all the other apps take too long to load.With the Fire tv they load faster and when watching series movies the chapters load automaticly as with with my smart tv I have to select every single tittle. It felt kind of a headache some times, but with the Fire tv n more and the picture look great!",pos
This item is excellent for easy search of movies and shows. Highly recommended!,pos
This item is the perfect tv radio treat I can ever give to my family they love it. Comes great and with everything you need to stay focused on the movies or tv shows playing.,pos
"I tried giving this a chance being that I'm an Amazon Prime member but in comparison to my 4th generation Apple TV, it falls way short. I really just wish Amazon would develop the app for tvOS.",neg
Great product for the price. I would buy NVIDIA shield if it wasn't too expensive,pos
"I love it, pretty fast!!! Good resolution, nice stream",pos
"The amazon fire tv box is by far my favorite box. We have roku smart tv's ,chromecast, fire tv sticks and a few others and the fire tv Box gets used so much more than the others. The beauty of this box is not only does it work wonders if you have an amazon prime account , but you can add any android app to it by simply side loading it using an android phone or your computer. The interface is very user friendly as well. My 3 year old navigates it by her self just fine. I would recommend this box over roku or nexus player.",pos
"It is super quick, alot faster than 2014 version. Alot better video quality imo",pos
Easy to navigate with plenty of apps. Simple connection,pos
Works flawlessly and love it. Great options and apps.,pos
"I found the Fire TV to be a great buy!! I love it and take it everywhere I can. Note that Prime TV does not work in some countries overseas, Netflix does so we still find a lot of things to watch when on the road. You can rent movies on Amazon (paid) but no Prime unfortunately. Other than that and if you are in the US, no problems and highly recommended!",pos
I have fire stick for few years and using it everyday. My smart TV is less smarter than it. I don't use the smart function of the TV. I purchased fire tv month ago and I can't live without it. An excellent product from Amazon. Highly recommended.,pos
It works great I love it. I used to have a firestick and this was an upgrade.,pos
"I love the Amazon Fire TV. I chose it over the the Fire Stick because I have 4K TVs.The picture is crystal clear. You need a strong Internet signal in order to Strem Effectively without all the buffering.This is a great option if you are tired of cable or just don't enjoy paying the high prices. You can access your favorite streaming Apps. (Hulu, Netflix, etc.)",pos
"I was first introduced to this product by a friend and ever since I had seen what it is capable of, I not only bought one, but two! I have referred this device to several family members along with friends and they all agreed how impressive it is.",pos

Much quicker than the fire tv stick! A nice upgrade,pos
I would recommend this buy. Better than the firestick.,pos
"We originally had a Fire Stick (and still use it with another TV). Once we subscribed to Sling, it seemed like streaming became more unreliable - increased buffering. We made two purchases to improve the situation: a Fire TV and a Wi-Fi booster. The two together definitely remedied the streaming issue. But the increased video crispness I/we give all the credit to Fire TV.",pos
"I upgraded from the 1st gen Fire TV to get 4k. Happy I did, 4k looks fantastic through Netflix/Amazon.",pos
Does everything I need it to and with great quality too! Couldn't have asked for a better product.,pos
Awesome product. Got 2 of them. No issues with streaming.,pos
I have another brand media player and amazon fire seems more friendly,pos
"This is truly a great streamer! I know you have other video streamers which are great and I'm sure they are but I used this video streamer for Pandora, YouTube, Netflix, CNBC, and Slingbox and I have to say, it is absolutely great. I've had no issues since installing it.",pos
"This is my first time using any Amazon products, so far so good no complaints.",pos

"The Fire TV is an impressive device. There are tons of apps available and enough content for everyone. I recently cut the cord with Comcast and mostly view Prime content, which loads and plays quickly. The remote is super easy to use too. Great product and great value.",pos
It is great to be able to watch movies commercial free and whenever we want.,pos
From a fire stick to this speed difference is huge. KODI add on is a bonus.,pos
Simple to setup and use. Would love to see more Google integration.,pos
"I love my fire amazon tv box it's fast reliable and cool to have ,I would highly recommend getting one",pos
I'm really happy that I purchased this Amazon Fire TV Box. It works great and so easy to use. Definitely worth the price!,pos
Amazon fire tv pretty nice highly recommend. 5 star item.,pos
Amazon Fire has a fast interface and offers all the services you would expect from a streaming box. The Playstation Vue app actually works better on my Fire than on my PS4.,pos
"Next to the Amazon fire stick, this 4K fire TV is the best bang for your buck. I just downloaded a free app that allows me to cast whatever I have on my iPad onto my TV. If you want to save some money the FireStick is very good, just not as fast and no usb or SD slots to upgrade memory and download apps (or whatever) to.",pos
You can't go wrong with this purchase. It works great and easy for kids to use.,pos
"We have been using Roku for a couple of years, when they started going bad decided to try something new. Now we have replaced both Roku with the Amazon Fire. Works great and looks good. Very portable and easy to hook up.",pos
"This device is such an excellent streaming product that will let you unlimited movies, tv shows and more!!!",pos
Out at the farm we set up a ClearStream 4 antenna and got about twice as many channels that we wanted to watch (total about 50). We needed an interface for streaming and this works great. In addition it gives us a remote control for our Tablo to record the shows with no subscriptions needed. Total cord cutting!,pos
Great product... One of the few to offer 4K streaming services.,pos

I love this product. Streams almost everything with no problem at all.,pos
"Get lots of apps and shows with a speedy menu, nice quality of the streams from Netflix and Amazon. Great purchase.",pos
"I have the Apple tv in one room and this in the other. Both are great boxes, but I must say this things absolutely flies when watching amazon instant videos. Almost zero buffering time even on 4K videos.",pos
"I bought the fire tv for using my Sling TV subscription. It works great but the only thing I don't like about this product is we cannot install apps from external sources, I tried to install an external app which worked fine for 2 days and stopped working later giving me message that the app was not installed from Amazon app store.",pos
"The Fire TV gives me everything I need from a media content perspective to watch shows and movies with several streaming media companies. Netflix, You Tube, etc. User interface is very easy. Going to be giving these as gifts for the family.",pos
Awesome product. Everything works great and easy to use,pos
This item was so great for our TV streaming needs we went back and bought another one for the other TV. Only down side is the remote is so small it is easy to lose. *beep* Alexa tell us a joke.,pos
Can you download drama fever application in this? Please share your answer..thank you,pos
"Bought this to compare to my Fire TV Stick. No comparison! No buffering, quick responses my button presses, and I wouldn't trade it for nothing!",pos
This is an excellent replacement for my Apple TV. I love it. Quick and easy to use. My whole family enjoys it.,pos
I enjoy it very much. It works good and does what it is supposed to do,pos
Easy to use and love the voice feature. Had roku's before and liked them. Think I like this even better.,pos
Works really well ! My kids love it and it's so easy to use !,pos
"Love this Amazon box, very great for putting Netflix and Hulu",pos
This device is awesome. This was the first box we bought that allowed us to download whatever apps we wanted. The first apple tv didn't allow that. I also love that it is android and therefore much more open than apple. Amazon has a decent amount of stuff with prime that adds to netflix and hulu if you are into watching shows by the season.,pos
Fast and easy to use. I watch Prime movies on it and also play games on it also. Best part you can add apps to it.,pos
"This is my second Amazon Fire TV, I got the second one with voice remote, but I don't seem to use the voice remote option that often, but I do like the Fire TV and use it frequently.",pos

"Bought for at home use, haven't been around enough to learn it",pos
"Love that I can access my amazon prime, along with the other services I subscribe to.",pos
"Having owned numerous streaming devices - Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, Fire TV stick and now Fire TV used on various TV sets in the house, I can say Fire TV is my favorite. The attractive interface and slick navigation, coupled with what I would consider excellent content, I truly enjoy my Fire TV the most. And future-proofed with 4K resolution just tops it off.",pos
"Use my fire tv daily, it is upgrade to the fire stick, we love it.",pos
This unit is very easy to use and comes with voice activated remote.,pos
"I have loved using Amazon Fire to watch movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime. The user interface is easy to operate, and is even better than Apple TV.",pos
"I love it best thing,I've bought in a long time,I didn't know I'd love it so much",pos
"I'm never paying for cable again! I'm so pleased with Amazon Fire box, we watch all our favorite tv shows and new. We have it all. And no $300 per month bill!",pos
Bought two of these 2015 models to add to my previous model on other sets in the house. Both of the new units freeze after about 10 - 15 minutes stating that my 16 MB connection speed isn't fast enough for watching old documentaries from my Prime account. Cycling the power gets it working until it freezes again. The old model works flawlessly. I'll be returning these.,neg
I own 3 in my household. To me no other streaming box comes close. A definite must buy !,pos
This device works as it is advertised to work. I'm very happy with this product. It is speedy fast processing and has great graphics.,pos
"I started with Netflix and have since added Fire TV. Its good to have options and you get it by adding Fire TV. We use Fire TV more than Netflix currently, so I guess that is the best endorsement I can make",pos
"I purchased the Fire tv box and it just stopped working one day. Wont boot, just sits at the logo. I spoke to customer service who could care less. They said the best they could do is sell me another box seeing that my warranty had expired. Its not like I bought this in 2012. Someone there even told me that if I have a ROKU box I can watch it with that instead. TOTALLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE! Me an my wife are long time Prime members and expected a little more from Amazon. I am on my way to buy an Nvidia Shield TV for my streaming needs. BTW it doesnt have an Amazon app (wink). This is the first box I have ever owned that just stopped working.",neg
More powerful then it's little brother. No hesitation at all. Love the fact that I can run a network cable to it instead of using wifi.,pos
Excellent product to be able to see thousands of free movies if you are a member of Amazon Prime.,pos
Wire TV works perfect if you want all of your steaming in one place.,pos
"This product is really useful, got to use it at a hotel.",pos
After several attempts to get help from Roku with no resolution I gave up and bought an Amazon Fire TV. This is by far the easiest to use. Love it!!!,pos
Great product I recommend it to everyone who loves watching tv,pos
"We switched from roku 3 to Amazon Fire. It has take some getting use too, but we like it. Several friends recommended it and I would recommend it.",pos
"We bought this for our bedroom and love that we can finally stream movies and tv shows while relaxing in bed. Plus I can shop on my tv from my bed, I love it!!",pos
This is a much better option than the Amazon Fire Stick. The picture quality is much better.,pos
Love it. Best decision ever right here . . dump cable and join the rest of the world.,pos
This is the coolest technology I purchased since putting Windows 10 on my new laptop. I love being able to use the microphone to ask questions and request music. Combined with my sound bar they blow everyone away that comes to visit me.,pos
I love it! I also have a fire stick. I got the firetv box thinking if I need to run Ethernet I can. But I've had no reason to. Processor is great!,pos
"I recommend everyone get this special product. The fire tv is so easy to use my five year old daughter knows how to use it. Everything is straight forward and is easy as one two three in setting up. I have tried other media players and this one take top billing. What are you waiting for, go get a fire tv if you haven't already.",pos
This works great. It is a great way to get rid of cable.,pos
The 2nd generation fire tv is great for Amazon services. This is my second fire tv and I purchased it to stream Playstation Vue. I love the Vue service and the fire tv is much faster than the fire tv stick,pos
"Way better than my older Roku! Unit doesn't freeze like my older Roku, very very satisfied!!",pos
What else can I say. This is a must have device for anyone willing to dump cable TV.,pos
"I love this divice, it has an amazing image, I will recomend it to any body, and ypu can install a lot of good apps",pos
Great product! Needed something I could travel with.,pos
Love everything about it. Does everthing it says it will only better than the other devices I have. The only negative is it does not have an optical out. But that is not something that would make me not buy it again.,pos
I have had no problems with the amazon tv. It streams fast and has a clear signal. And has a clear picture.,pos
Love this amazon fire. Great talking piece for the newbies. Easy to install,pos
We were tired of cable failure via mediacom and we're looking for a cables and dish less tv system. A friend of one of our friends told us about the fire system. We went out and bought it then purchased sling. We are very pleased with this decision.,pos
Awesome product great value! I can stream from Netflix and Hulu and is much faster than the FireStick.,pos
"This is great. It's pretty quick, it works, has USB connections for data, or for a mouse + keyboard, it's small, strong and neat. 4K is okay... but still not a ROKU 4 in terms of screen quality in my opinion. Although Fire is feels a little snappier, less noisy and heats less than the ROKU 4. I like it and will obviously keep it, but 4 stars just because there's room to improve it to be a nicer 4K streamer.",pos
The best bang for the buck in streaming tv. Buy 1 for each tv,pos
"THIS IS EASY TO USE, I ALSO HAVE A ROKU AND I THINK I LIKE THIS BETTER. IT TOOK ME A FEW MINUTES TO GET USE TO THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE ROKU REMOTE TO THE FIRE REMOTE, BUT NOW IT AWESOME",pos
So many features than even my 5 yr old has no prob using it . Love it,pos
I bought it as an addition to my cable service and it is meeting my needs and expectations for the product.,pos
Would highly recommend this product. Offers variety of TV watching.,pos
Great variety in free movies and tv to watch as well as games!,pos
"Device is easy to install and user friendly. Best media streaming in my opinion, a must buy.",pos
Great simple to use light weight and love that's its wireless,pos
Amazon-Fire was instrumental in providing us a quality HD picture to our TV!,pos
Allowed me to cut my satellite service and save $100 a month. No worrying about commercials or missing shows.,pos
Amazon Fire works very well for my family. It is a great time for family to watch movies together,pos
Works as described. I really like the ease of use when it comes to the interface.,pos
Accessable for all TVs in the house and not having to buy a stick for each tv would be 5*'s,pos
"Amazon, did a good job with this box. The factory andriod allows for plug and use or modify it up!",pos
Great addition to my outdoor cinema. I have a strong network outside and though I am 50 feet from my house I can still stream movies without buffering,pos
My first dedicated streaming box and it works great. Plenty of apps to watch my shows and the remote is simple to learn. Also having access to my Amazon purchased movie and prime shows/movies is a nice bonus.,pos
Bought to use with PlayStation view as my tv provider. It works great so far.,pos
"I would have given this product 5 stars however the only thing I do not like is the limited amount of local storage space (8gb)... Other than that this is honestly my favorite piece of tech that I have ever purchased... The performance and speed is second to none, especially when connected to the internet via via hardwire Ethernet cable.. I recommend this product to everyone. Thank you.",pos
"For starters i had the Amazon stick for a while & got tired of that due to all the buffering issues, but what can you expect out of that little stick? so when this went on sale, i decided to upgrade & i'am so happy i did, it works great & has reduced the buffering to a minimum, but like anything online depends on the site your on. Love the fact you can speak into the remote and pull up the site you want.",pos
Very nice product. Works great with my tv. The menu is simple and the software is very responsive.,pos
Great addition to any media center. Easy to use and great picture and sound quality!,pos
"bought this for my kids new tv, it is very easy for them to use.",pos
"It's fast, it's 1080p and you can do more with it than the others",pos
The Amazon Fire TV is an excellent product. It has so many capabilities that I can never use them all. Connects both wired and wi-fi. I have Amazon Prime and get more free stuff that really expands the experience.If you have kids they can take the use to a whole new level.,pos
"The Amazon fireTV is a good Roku replacement. It does push Prime and Amazon fee based content, but the Fire TV is smooth and has some nice features like Alexa (when you push the microphone button on the remote), free games, and voice search. Overall, it's a pretty cool product.",pos
Great its the box that will save me money. A must buy,pos
If you're a movie nutt and want to save on cable..,pos
"I have purchased several fire sticks through out my house, this one thus far as been the best. Loving the voice search it's like having siri on your tv.",pos
I love it ! Tons of options and endless entertainment,pos
Great for Amazon Netflix etc... Even better for more advance users Kodi!!,pos
"I used Google Chromecast before but by far, this is the best, even better than Apple tv. I have also Amazon echo so this even makes it better for me.",pos
"Easy to use, lots of apps. So far have really enjoyed!",pos
"I got this fire TV because my fire TV stick didn't get good wifi reception in my bedroom. It has wired networking, so it works great! It's snappier than the fire TV.stick and does the same stuff.",pos
It is Great. I use it all the time easy to use great product,pos
Main reason for getting the Amazon TV was for better streaming experience of PlayStation Vue. The Amazon Fire TV handles Vue streaming w/o issues and the interface is very easy and user friendly. I also like the ability to root the device for third party apps.,pos
Very useful and easy to navigate! Def recommend to anyone who loves to stream!,pos
Bought the fire tv box because the stick was a bit slow and hardly had any space. The box works great and i don't have any streaming issues.,pos
Pluses and minuses when compared to the Roku. Plus - can use the Alexa feature Minus- can not use the USB port to play videos from a USB like on the Roku. Plus - some channels not found on the Roku ( i think ) Minus - harder to find Channels when compared to the Roku.All and all a nice streamer,pos
I like this device it is great to customize and use it for android development .,pos
"Perfect, fast, smooth... 4K .... It's best in market btw... Better than Apple TV",pos
"This thing is awesome next best thing to having cable. The tv show and movie content is great with the download of Kodi app. I would highly recommend this to anyone. It even has the built in alexa, which can give you local weather, traffic reports etc.",pos
Easy to install! We bought two one for each tv!!!!,pos
It has everything we need so cable is not needed in this house!,pos
Works incredibly!!! I will never go back to cable/satellite again!!!,pos
Easy setup. Loaded with many service/content providers. Some are fee based. Some provide free content. You choose which ones to view from. I only use the free ones. I would say that the quality of the streaming programs definitely depends on the quality/speed of your internet connection. So negotiate the best deal you can get for the fastest service you can afford. BTW... search the net to learn how to set this up with apps that allow you to stream stuff you never thought could be free. Enjoy.,pos
"Great for streaming Amazon Prime amongst others. This is a must have, especially if a 4K tv is owned. Love it. Quick navigation speed, due to the memory and processor this box exhibits.",pos
Streaming works great! Very fluent! Very fast processing power!,pos
Buy this if you want to use PlayStation Vue. Don't get the fire stick!,pos
Great iream i use it kodi and runs great easy to install.,pos
Best part about this unit is it works with KODI. Easy to setup and use. The remote is small and easy to understand. For the price I would highly recommend this above all the others.,pos
"Fast, supports ultra 4K, expandable memory, side load apps.What's not to love?",pos
A welcome addition to online streaming. Easy menu and controls for navigation.No buffering issues noticed.,pos
"The amazon fire tv is a really good streaming unit. I cut the cord about a year ago and I have a roku 3 that I also use. Only 2 complaints about the fire tv: 1) amazon pushes their services at you. If you can get past that, it's worth it. 2) the WiFi connection is not as strong as the roku 3. I've had to basically leave the fire tv upstairs (router is upstairs) and the roku downstairs. When I've tried to use the fire tv downstairs it buffers continuously. The roku has never buffered. I like both as both offer some channels not available on the other. I'll look into wifi-extenders so that I can use either throughout the house.",pos
"Works great, allows the use of cat 6 and wireless use.",pos
Items is very easy and a noob friendly. I love the item.,pos
This was the best upgrade I've made I love the firestick but the box is much better!!!!!,pos
"Good product, more convienece & good price. Do and I will recommend to my friends",pos
Fast streaming of your favorite shows and games lots of memory and sd card for more memory HD view with 4K capabilities,pos
Has worked very well with Sling TV and other streaming apps.,pos
Great addition to my Home entertainment system. Would recommend.,pos
"Having used a number of streaming devices, I would rate the Firetv as one of the best.Well worth the extra that a fire stick costs. Voice recognition is awesome and you can plug directly into your router to minimize buffering.",pos
We love these so much we've put one on each floor of our house so we don't have to move them from our basement or living room.,pos
"Nothing really great about it. It's basically a box to watch Amazon on demand. I have a smart tv, so to me this useless.",neg
Work well with my televisions. I am pleased with this product.,pos
Best investment I've made! Doesn't really buffer like the other sticks .,pos
My family and I enjoy spending time together watching movies for relaxation and entertainment. The Amazon product has been easy to use.,pos
great product would definitely recommend fir other,pos
"I cancelled my satellite service and bought the fire tv after using the firestick, and liking it. It's a great product, and with my amazon prime membership, gives us lots of viewing options, especially for the kids who don't mind not seeing the latest episode of their shows (we also signed up for playstation vue to take the place of our satellite service, which is available on the fire tv). The kids also enjoy all the games on it. The only issue is that many of the games that the kids want to play require a separate controller, which seems to always be out of stock whenever we think about ordering one.",pos
"wel worth the upgrade from the amazon stick to the amazon fire.. more room to catch the memory buffer, lot smoother and a better control. works wonders making me one happy customer.",pos
"I bought this for PlayStation Vue, and I am very satisfied with it. Highly recommend!",pos
"I have enjoyed having the ability to watch almost any movies that I would like to see. This even includes movies that are being shown in the theaters at that time. Occasionally we have hit some streaming that tends to pause the show, but mostly we can find a go around by choosing another streaming!",pos
"I love this streamer. The fact that all the apps I use are on this machine and the service from Amazon is amazing, it's very worth the money. Alexa is easy to use also. A recommended buy.",pos
"Works great, highly recommend. Great alternative to cable",pos
Friends of mine have one and said how great it was. I have the amazon fire stick in the house but thought this would be better in my living room. Easy set up.,pos
This is thing is awesome next best thing to having cable the tv show and movie content is tremendous with the Kodi app I would highly recommend this to anyone Firestick or firetv ditch the dish and get Firetv!!!,pos
"I love the fire sticks but sometimes not crazy about using wifi. The fire tv can be hard wired, which limits some buffering issues. Not that it's ever really been an issue. It's still really easy to use and setup just like the fire stick.",pos
got one for me and for my older daughter. love it a lot,pos
"I am an Amazon Prime member so the Amazon Fire Tv seems to be a no brainer. I took advantage of the Sling Tv offer where you prepay for 3 months you get $50 off of the streaming device. So, basically for $10 more you get 3 months of 20 channels, that's a good deal. Take advantage of it.",pos
"love the easy set up, the navigation is very intuitive. Great to have access to all my music uploaded to Amazon Prime Music. Alexa works well too to play and pause music and shows.",pos
"Set up was easy and load times and picture quality is amazing. The only set back is you have to purchase pretty much anything. I understand buying a movies , but to have to buy tv episodes is a draw back. I could just stick with my direct tv for that",pos
"I got this because my fire stick always gives a warning that it is too hot. Haven't had this problem but did experience problem. I have my ps4, apple tv, running through a hdmi switch. no problem when I had the fire stick plugged in. The amazon TV will not work with the switch. For it to work it needs to be connected directly. I have three tv's and three different switches didn't work on any and yes I tried different chords. Other than that works great.",pos
The product it's left works GREAT! Especially compared to the Stick. It is so much faster and has more memory that you are not constantly get the low memory notifications. Only problem is the lack of available apps on the App Store.,pos
Can't stream smoothly unless plugged directly into the modem. Buffering was horrible (did not have this problem with Roku). Even plugged in it has some trouble with buffering at times. Only bought this because I got Playstation Vue and it only runs on certain systems. Unless you actually need the Amazon Fire to stream something only it can stream I would not recommend it. Roku is a much better system.,neg
This item is one of the sweetest things I have ever brought.,pos
Easy to set up and use. Love it for streaming you tube and other apps. Voice command is awesome!,pos
I love my amazon TV. It works great for my needs and I can also enjoy playing games on it.,pos
My husband loves the fire stick .It gives all the old movies he loves and he can do amazing things with the sound as the fire stick allows many adjustments.Streaming is faster too.,pos
I bought the Fire TV strictly for Playstation Vue and Netflix...worth every penny.,pos
Love this much more than cable tv. Children really enjoy it too.,pos
Easy installation and operation. It took about 10 minutes from beginning to watching.,pos
Very easy to use and worth every penny! I would recommend this to anyone who needed smart tv capabilities.,pos
works as expected no issues and I am good with prodcut,pos
Love the movies and songs it is a great product. Tx,pos
this is my favorite set-top box. You have all the same functions as the others but you can also side load apps as well such as Kodi and emulators to play old school games like Super Mario and Zelda. If you have amazon prime the Alexa feature is pretty awesome as well finding music on prime and getting random information.,pos
Easy to set up. Works great. Helpful tutorial. Would recommend over a Roku.,pos
"I bought this to sideload Kodi on to it. A very wise choice, indeed! I no longer have to lug my computer out to my TV and attach via HDMI. It's ALWAYS on with AFTV! I haven't really used it for anything but Kodi and Netflix, but LOVE IT! Run out and buy this , NOW!",pos
Great product just couldn't get my international chanels,pos
"Love this thing, it's super fast and very little to no buffering when streaming my movies.",pos
"Purchased for viewing Amazon prime. Loaded a couple apps and set it to sleep. When I returned a few hours later it was stuck in a perpetual boot and was not recoverable. I will get another as I like the features and price point, just a little soured by this first impression. I'm checking that I would not recommend to a friend but am hoping this will change with the second one. to be continued...",neg
Super durable hardware that has endless features. From streaming to playing games. this thing is awesome,pos
This is not our first Amazon Fire---we have them on every TV in the house (cord cutting) and over the years Amazon products have proven reliable. Best Buy was a great option for purchasing--they met the online price (their everyday price was exact with the online prices I saw) and I didn't have to wait for delivery.,pos
I got this for running kodi and it does the job much better than the stick. Definitely worth the extra. Much faster and the Alexia on the remote is awesome.,pos
"We bought the Fire TV box a few weeks ago to help save cost on cable tv. So far this has been a great alternative. We only have internet now and subscribe to Amazon Prime for around $100 a year. We subscribe to two other apps for $26 a month to get ESPN channels for basketball season and archived shows on CBS. The Fire TV box is easy to setup and use and there is also a Fire TV app that can be downloaded and used to control the box from a tablet or phone in addition to the Fire TV remote. There are thousands of tv shows and movies with the Amazon Prime subscription that are free.One nice feature is if we start a movie or show and don't finish one day we can go back the next day and resume where we left off. Another plus is the ""Alexa"" voice activated assistant to look up tv shows and movies and more just by asking. We have cut our cable cost by more than half. We did buy a digital antenna to get local tv in additon to the Fire TV box. So far we love our Fire TV.",pos
I have a few of things and they all work great. Gonna get another one soon.,pos
Loved it... great for streaming movies and tv shows. bought several of them for family and friends.,pos
We dropped our cable company and now have the fire stick . We are saving money and don't miss the cable company one bit!!!!,pos
This product is great for all movie and show geeks.,pos
It is very easy to set up and easy to use. I love the slick looks.,pos
It works for what I use it for which is PlayStation vue. My only complaint is that the remote could be better quality.,pos
It is a Great product and it was all I expected in this product.,pos
I have Amazon Prime and this is a must for it. Very happy with it.,pos
It is great and even has an app to use ur phone as the remote if u lose the remote behind the couch or bed.,pos
Its a great alternate for expensive canle tv services!,pos
I had a older version of this product the new version is far superior and a pleasure to use compared to the old one,pos
The only knock I have with this product is that it does not support vudu movie app. So...I have to connect to it through other means,pos
I would encourage everyone to get this product to save on the cost of cable/satellite. A must have!,pos
I went from an Amazon Fire stick to this tv and there is literally no lag in response time!,pos
Best if you have amazon prime but you don't need it.,pos
We love this option for home movies. Easy to set up and very user friendly.,pos
"This little set top box packs a big punch, it is an absolute must for any media center. The processor is very fast compared to its counter part the Fire TV stick, no buffering issues and an expandable memory slot. You can also use wireless keyboards and a mouse to alleviate those remote clicks when searching for something. The voice activated remote is a beauty just say anything you want to it and it will look it up for you within the Amazon apps. This is a great add on to any entertainment center setup.",pos
Amazon fire box all that and then some. Very satisfied with my purchase.,pos
"Not sure what will happen if it gets dropped, Doesn't appear to adequately cover the screen, Looks really good!",pos
"Replaced Uverse with Amazon Fire TV PlayStation Vue, good streaming, easy to use, compact footprint.",pos
I bought this for my parents for Christmas and so far it does not disappoint. the ease of use and the selections are amazing. if you have amazon prime it links up even better and gives you access to all the videos and things it offers! great product.,pos
"We go this for PlayStation vue. But with prime, there are so many options.",pos
The fire tv works well with wifi or hardwired. Great for streaming netflix or sling tv.,pos
You'll never need cable again!! All you have to have is the Internet and depending out what kind of build you put on your fire TV that's all you'll ever need!,pos
Love it!!! I can watch all my shows on it and save money by cutting off cable!!!,pos
Very easy to use and I like the voice search. The Bluetooth headphones come in handy at night. We get to enjoy all the features with our prime account.,pos
I like it because it easy to use and easy to install,pos
"This device is like an all in one entertainment machine!! I really enjoy how easy it is to use and what is even better is that I am able to stream PlayStation Vue through this device. Now I can cancel my expensive cable subscription and just keep on ""vueing"" right now my couch potatoe life is on fire!!",pos
This is a great streaming device so many options. I love Amazon Fire tv.,pos
I'm glad I made this purchase. I can now choose from hundreds of movies to watch. The Amazon fire tv allows for storing personal pictures and seeking assistance from Alexa. Great buy! I do not ever plan on paying for digital or cable TV again.,pos
"Got this on sale and it's very good, the interface is easy to use and super easy to set up",pos
Love the new 4K Amazon box .. Looks great on my tv,pos
I would totally recommend purchasing Amazon Fire TV! I have enjoyed the simplicity of use and the app I was wanting Plex ! Best Buy had the best price for it so I purchased it from there local store!,pos
Great Product to use with a Non-Smart TV or a Smart TV which is not compatible with Amazon Music.,pos
"best streaming device for the money,not very happy with the changes from amazon on blocking some apps.May change to a different device",pos
This is one of the best streaming boxes I've had. Can easily interface it with kodi and also anything you may have on your kindle fire integrates as well. It's an awesome little box. Would purchase it again in a heartbeat.,pos
Transitioning away from standard tv and this worked great!,pos
"Great system for streaming Playstation Vue service, very responsive, Alexa is a plus. Kudos Amazon!",pos
"excellent picture quality, it does not froze at all.",pos
This is easy to set up and what I really like is with the Ethernet connection there's rarely buffering,pos
I have no use for cable because I have everything I could ever need in the fire tv.,pos
Built in wifi support is much better than the fire stick.. Less buffering,pos
"The interface isn't my favorite, but the unit is fast and responsive. It makes loading my son's favorite shows easy. Picture quality is great. I have mine hard wired to the router, so I cannot comment on Wi-Fi speed.",pos
All I can say is wow. This is a really nice box. I would recommend it.,pos
"With this amazing toy, you won't need to pay for outrageous monthly cable bills, just buy this and no more cable bills.",pos
i love the alexa voice service i can turn on my lights and order pizza with my voice through the fire tv.. the apps are the same as any other media device.. games are good too..,pos
"Exelente streaming box, ultra fast and no buffering!",pos
It does what it says it does. Straightforward to set up too.,pos
"This device has been designed taking into account performance. In the past I used SmartTVs to see online content such as Netflix and Youtube, but the experience was always bad (slow response, hangs/freeze because of low memory, horrible interface and complicated controls). Now with the Amazon Fire TV everything works as expected: (1) Always ready, no need to shutdown, no need to wait, just turn on the TV and you are ready to play, (2) It's fast, very fast, no need to wait for loading apps, exiting or entering, (3) controls are very easy to use, very responsive - the multi-core processor is magic!Also, you can select from almost any streaming service you prefer (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Crackle, etc). Other devices offer less streaming options - is not because you need all of them, but you can change your mind at any point of time and you will not be stucked with your device.",pos
This device is easy to setup very fast and provides a great quality picture.,pos
"It takes a lot of time and subscribing to get the channels I want, so I will write another review next year when I got them all..hopefully !!",neg
I just love this product. This is my 2nd and this is very flexible and open as against apple TV. I replaced my apple TV with fireTVs and I just love them.,pos
"I bought this to replace an aging Apple TV and have been very pleasantly surprised with it. It streams in 4k, which my Apple TV did not do, and I have Kodi installed to stream media from a home server to my TV. Great product and worth the money!",pos
Is a god but i have to pay 100 dollar a year is to bad,neg
I love the fact it is a small unit takes up almost no space and has great features,pos
"Love the amount of apps on this thing. Love that I can watch anything with Bluetooth headset while I'm cleaning. I love the speak to commend. However, I wish you can request more than one route for traffic reports. My husband and I travel to different locations everyday.",pos
Makes me want to ditch cable since everyone has fought over the firestick.,pos
"Love the Amazon Fire. 4K quality, the remote ,and the ability to use it while traveling put this over the top. Plus it's less expensive than the Roku and Apple TV.",pos
"I love my my fire TV, it has everything you need to stream shows/movies to your TV.",pos
"fast- jitter free, buffering a minimal amount of time with a 100/100 network",pos
Great price and product is very good ..I will recommend anyone,pos
"I bought this Fire TV 3 months ago. One day, out of the blue, it stopped working. Power is on but as soon after I see the Amazon logo the screen goes black. I google the problem and it seems that the only way to reset it to the factory mode is by the on screen menu so there is no way for me to do it. I just emailed the company and waiting for a response since it is unacceptable that this thing only lasted 3 months before it became useless. Not a happy camper here!!!",neg
I love Amazon Fire tv. It works well because it offers the Fox News and my shows I like on PS Vue,pos
we love our fire tv. we highly recommend fire tv so much we cancelled our cable!,pos
This product is easy to use and is better than any tv service u could get,pos
"Better and cheaper than cable, the only thing I am missing is the closed caption",pos
My only frustration is that you can't use a flash drive to view video or photos without purchasing a app that may or may not work. Other than that the product is awesome!,pos
"I was using a Roku box and various game consoles before this for Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming platforms but the Amazon Fire TV really is the best option out there currently. The device is fast and responsive, includes tons of different apps and integrations and best of all has Alexa support for search. If you're a Amazon Prime member especially, this device is a must have.",pos
Awesome product worth it would recommend it Anybody,pos
perfect android box for your living room never miss a movie a sporting event or your favorite shows when you and Kodi just buy it,pos
"I am definitely happy with my purchase. It's a very good android box, even if most of the content seems to be amazon content with the ability to sideload (install other android apps not from the amazon store) this makes one of the top android boxes. Also the ability to play some games makes it a plus. (just buy a microsd card since memory is limited to 8GB on this box)",pos
"If your a prime member this is a must have. It does a great job streaming all of your prime media and your personal media. It does a great job with Netflix too, so if your an Amazon fan this is the box for you.",pos
The supplied Amazon Bluetooth remote control will not pair back with the main unit. This is the second one I bought with the same issue. Re-Pairing the remote is quite simple per the instructions but to no avail. Had to use a android remote with a usb dongle to operate the unit. Going through batteries like crazy trying to get it to pair back up no more than three inches from main unit.,neg
Great device for the amazon prime holder with 4k support.,pos
"Easy to use reliable interface possible house hold money saver, if properly moded lol",pos
The absolute best streaming device I've ever used.,pos
"I love the fire tvits great to stream netflix....amazon, it also lets u download games",pos
I've tried several tv boxes but this one is so far the best,pos
"I use this device to watch Playstation Vue and SlingTv, amazing device, it streams SlingTv more smoothly than my xbox one, also the quality of video hardly ever drops, if it does its my internet and not the device. Great for the price, 100% recommended.",pos
"It works will, some time it get slow to switch from Chanel to Chanel.",pos
The fire tv box streams really well and might just be better than my Roku 3.,pos
"I own a high end system with AppleTV 3 and Chromcast media players for Netflix and the likes. I purchased fire tv for 4K. As with other devices I thought I could configure it and forget it. This is not the case with Fire TV. Remote control requires constant attention. Open the back play with batteries, but battery cover back on. Constantly! HDMI port does not work with HDMI switch. It is the only device that I own that does not play well with my switch. Internet connection is poor. Start receiving video won't load errors after a week. I thought perhaps WiFi connection was bad even though no other device had this issue, so I tried wired connection and got same error. Tried restarting it more than any device should need but this did not help. Device is very hot. It is on constantly. No automatic method of turning off when not being used.On the plus side, the interface is the best I seen on any media player. Beautiful picture and screen saver which can be configured. Alexia rocks but limited to basic commands. Amazon Prime integration is excellent as you might expect. Beautiful looking device. After about 10 days I got fed up and returned it. I'll wait for AppleTV to integrate 4K. Hopefully that will be soon.",neg
Product runs so smoothly. Way better than the fire-stick. And it allows you to do so much more.,pos
"I'm loving my fire TV. I had a fire stick which I've since moved to the bedroom. I like that I can hardwire the box versus using only wifi on the stick. The biggest thing is that PlayStation Vue, Playstation's new TV streaming service, is only available on a few platforms and Amazon fire TV/ stick is one. So now I have my Hulu, Netflix, and PS Vue all in one place. The fire TV is a cord cutters best friend.",pos
I bought this so I can stream the playstation vue app and it works great. Very speedy and seems to be faster than the Roku 4. I would highly recommend this if you are trying to cut cords and want a set top box for streaming.,pos
"Got it on sale, works well but it's a bit slow when buffering.Overall we like it.",pos
I would recommend this product to all my friends and family!,pos
Having the freedom to pay foe what you want to watch instead of a package.,pos
This device can do it all . The device also has nice voice command.,pos
"I purchased this because I was looking for a device that could stream lots of content on a TV in the garage and let me tell you, this was money well spent, lots of great apps, plenty of streaming services, perfect for anyone looking for something inexpensive but still get a lot of features!",pos
"I love it,that keeps them out of my living room so that they can watch tv in their room",pos
Obviously doesn't support everything out there but it's fast and does what I need it to,pos
Love my Amazon FireTv Stick. Bought one for my whole family.,pos
"This is installed in a sewing room in lieu of a cable box with a monthly fee. She uses it with prime movies and tv shows (best of all, I don't have to watch)I did set it up and tried voice search. It works great>",pos
Love the speed and the quality of this product. Watch all my shows in great definition.,pos
Works way faster than my android box and is just awsome,pos
Was easy to use and easy to set up programming was easy to do,pos
At first I had Amazon Fire stick but I had too many problems with the screen freezing. Having some memory solved the problem. My router is in the basement 2 floors down. My only gripe is I haven't found a way to organize apps or shows like Apple TV. Got this so I could get PS Vue. Now I have programming I like in addition to Amazon Prime programming. I do get concerned with the possible data usage fees that major internet providers keep trying to impose. Otherwise I'm happy with the device.,pos
"I have a pretty fast and stable internet connection, 65Mbps down.So when I tried to stream some 4K content, it kept buffering to the point that it just wouldn't load the video anymore. Even streaming 1080p content had some issues. So i used the dedicated apps on my tv to see if I had the same problem, nope. It worked flawlessly! This product just plain sucks.",neg
"I was exited about it but got disappointed. Same old GUI , 4K is limited. Search option is only for Amazon ...",neg
"I was so excited to start streaming 4k with this and the disappointment was terrible. It just never seemed to hit 4k while my Smart TV has no problem with it. The only reason I bought it was because I loved the original Fire TV and loved the setup. Also, it was glitchy and laggy. I gave it 2 days and returned it.",neg
One of the important reasons I purchased this was for HBO Go app which they have but does not work with Charter-Comcast. A quite large market of People affected so a useless claim they readily put out there that you can play it. What else can you not use it for I haven't found yet but Amazon has not written me back after I emailed them about this issue. Im stuck with waste of Money and will go get a Google Chrome now.,neg
"Pros:- Amazon Prime works on it.- You can still sideload apps, like Kodi.Cons:- Not a good upgrade over the original Fire TV, is worse in some aspects.- Remote buttons are hard to press (compared to original Fire TV)- Remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix- Interface isn't as snappy as the original Fire TV- Same interface as the original Fire TV: There's still no good way to sort your apps or locate the Prime content that you want.- Voice search seems about the same as the original Fire TV. Alexa adds nothing significant. You still can't use it to search in 3rd party apps, like Youtube.- As for video decoding in Kodi, performance isn't much better than the original Fire TV. You will be able to play HEVC content at 1080p with no problem, but 1080p .264 hi10p (software-decoded) does not play well. There's simply not enough power. 4k decoding is hit-and miss. It needs to be specifically coded for this Fire TV (low bitrate, low fps) to work properly.- Overall system performance is bad. When sitting idle, the CPUs spike up to 60% usage and memory is at 60% usage. The OS is not well-optimized.I'm not confident that Amazon can fix these issues in a timely manner and their competitors are releasing their media players soon, so I'll likely return this while I still can.",neg
"Basically has almost the same content as a Roku 3 would provide, but in a much more clunkier menu. I can get a better Amazon menu layout via the Amazon app on the Roku 3. Also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via FOX sports network (FS1), that is not happening. You can add the channel free, but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters. There is NO way I am signing back up for cable or satellite. I wish FS1 would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as HBO and Showtime do. It's a thumbs down for me.",neg
Bought the fire TV excited about the 4K support. The first night it refused to load video content. I could only stream music. Now it refuses to load at all. It has completely stopped responding to the remote. Remote feels cheap.,neg
"It's somewhat of a step up from the Roku 3 I was previously using, but not as much as I was expecting. I think it's a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is now.Spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why I could only connect to my dual-band router at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz. 1.5 hours on the phone with Verizon FiOS tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at 5GHz without issue. Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider. Voice search works well if you want only to be presented with Amazon's viewing options, for some reason I thought search was universal, but only movies and TV shows available through Amazon show up. Bummer :-(The FireTV-2 is OK, less than I was expecting and with other good options around the corner, I'm beginning to doubt my choice...",neg
Works great. Have had no issues at all. Love it! :),pos
For a device with 4k Technology they don't seem to advertise it much. You can barely see it on the box. Also search feature only works for Amazon. That's a waste of a search feature. Remote disconnects from the box often and your have to take the batteries out of the remote to reset it. I would not recommend until Amazon fixes the bugs.,neg
"I have been using Amazon Fire products for almost a year when they first came out, and the 2nd generation Fire TV box is much faster! It is easy to use, and I can access all my favorite streaming video apps - and Amazon Prime services are great! There is so much content available with this device.Now adding Alexa integrates with the Alexa app on my phone. I can see my shopping list, which comes in handy.",pos
I've had the chromecast for years and never really had any problems with it besides the occasional freeze when casting videos too big.Decided it was time to upgrade since SlingTV had a $50 promotion off any SlingTV capable device. The decision was probably one of my best purchases of the year. Now I can watch 4k content and stream videos without any lag.,pos
"Love it. Was debating on getting it first, but have no regrets after using it.",pos
I have 4 of the Gen 1 Fire Tv boxes and they are good showing their age. I purchased the new FireTV only be to disappointedPros.. SD Card slotCons.. Many Apps just don't work or are buggy...Search is terrible and only gives Amazon options .. Nvidia Shield also gives my plex server option .. now that is cool... not much faster.. if at all than Gen 1,neg
"It kept freezing when I first hooked it up. I couldn't type anything in because it kept resetting. After a couple days it started working, when I was ready to return it, so I decided to keep it. Need to be patient with it.",pos
The box needs a 4k tv for maximal viewing pleasure. Will not turn your tv into a 4 k machine. Sure will help a little with graphics. If that where the case people would buy cheaper tvs then this box. And it is much faster than original. I have box for different rooms.,pos
Love this little device as it runs better Than other boxes. It's a simple machine that has great capability.,pos
Good streaming box for 4K with Netflix and Amazon prime. Has issue with sound not balanced or randomly lowering or going really loud.,neg
Works great for streaming apps. Much better than a chromecast.,pos
I especially like the integration of Netflix and the voice control.,pos
Barely 4k content and it lags a lot. Not worth it. Returned!,neg
"I purchased this firetv to upgrade my from first firetv version as I have a samsung 4k tv, this new firetv recognized my hdmi port as 4k compatible when I set the resolution to 4k on video settings, after trying all posible settings, this bug only gives 1080 even playing 4k content. firetv1=firetv2.",neg
"I had the first generation fire tv and I really don't see any reason to upgrade. Sure it has 4k support but only for Amazon movies, not Netflix. I returned this device.",neg
Android unfortunately always is buggy and whether its nexus or amazon they have the task of cleaning up the bugs and unlike some people I am not complaining. The bugs will be fixed soon just like the first one. Anyways...this device is giving more everything at the same price. Thanks Amazon,pos
Got 1 of this when it 1st came out. Returned the unit coz it won't boot up. Advantage buying from Bestbuy easy exchange or return. The second unit that i got works perfectly.,pos
Love this thing so fast when uploading video can wait to do more with it,pos
Great for when I'm on the road and I can plug it in to use at any hotel I stay at. Easily understood and versatile to use.,pos
"not as big as the fire box yet its not that much slower, very satisfied",pos
Easy to setup and navigate- several TV/Movies available in UHD,pos
i loved it and it works well if you have a kodi installed.,pos
it is very nice to be able to get all the shows and movies I want to watch,pos
I love this product and my kids use it everyday to watch movies and serials.,pos
"Overall, my kids love it. I originally had a defective remote, but I was able to return the item and obtain a replacement without any problems.",pos
This is a great step up from the ATV which I had 3,pos
"Wonderful product, seemed operation. No buffering even on a slow dsl connection. I will recommend this to anyone.",pos
I like this better than Apple TV. Easy to maneuver.,pos
I got this awesome gadget to use it with my 4 k tv.,pos
This is a great item to have if you don't watch live tv. It has plenty of pre installed apps and downloads to keep anyone busy.,pos
"The Amazon Fire met all my expectations. I would highly recommend this unit over the Roku 3. It is easy to install. Of course, Amazon has terrific online / phone support. The Fire has a competitive price point. The Remote is much more intuitive and easy to use versus the Roku 3. There are many more apps and ""How-to's"" on YouTube. My unit is more versatile than the Roku 3. Plus the Amazon ""behemoth"" is committed to making the Fire the best video/music streamer at a reasonable cost with many app options. Amazon is not going away soon! However, be careful, this unit can be very additive.",pos
Gave up on Apple TV and tried this sucker out. Has Sling TV and Plex among Amazon Prime so it's very good compares to other streamers out there.,pos
"After about two weeks I ended up returning this item. It constantly froze and when it was working it was no faster than my fire stick.The voice search was a joke. I'm pretty tied in to the Amazon ecosystem, I love my Echo, but I was disappointed with this device. And for a hundred dollars? No thanks.",neg
"Easy setup, nice OS, no issues whatsoever, voice recognition in the remote is sweet and works well.",pos
very fast amazon stick replaced my apple tv 2also installed apps with ease,pos
"I bought the Fire TV because, as much as I liked my Fire Stick, I found it was not great at buffering and I found that often the image on the screen would freeze. The Fire TV doesn't have that issue, and the controls and action and responsiveness to the remote are very smooth. Also the voice control works wonderfully.",pos
"Very easy to set up.Easy to navigate, clear picture!",pos
"Overall this is a good streaming device. Pro: Almost every service is available. SlingTV performance here is better than Nexus TV, Fire Stick, or Chromecast. Can do some casual gaming. Available cheap with the SlingTV Best Buy deal. Cons: Sometimes returns to home screen. Included controller sometimes disconnects. UI is better than Roku, but that isn't saying much.",pos
I will use this until it blows up. So nice to touch one button and get anything you want,pos
Very easy to use and easy to understand. Alexa on it is awesome.,pos
"will begin by saying, I truly enjoy Amazon's products. I rarely go anywhere without my Kindle Paperwhite, and while I don't use it too much, I love the functionality and convenience of the Kindle Fire. While there are other tablets that probably do more, the Fire does exactly what I want and need it to do, and for that I am very happy.",pos
by far the best streaming box out there i loved the first one too but all the new stuff on this one is wow 4 times faster and better wifi cant go wrong love it if you aint got one go get it this is rhe game changer !,pos
this thing will do anything... Will def by more and recommend it,pos
If you want an upgrade this product is for you. Great media streamer,pos
Good product..............................................................................................................,pos
Box works good with Kodi. Voice feature isn't as good as apple tv.,pos
Great device when working correctly. Every once and a while it gets slow with connectivity and the remote has its days that it doesn't work.,pos
I like the definition but the software has bugs. I had to return mine.,pos
If you have Amazon Prime I would Recommend. . It is equally build and quality is good. Interface is nice and easy. Games not so good.,pos
Much better than the first generation Amazon Fire TV. Very fast and reliable.,pos
The fire tv serves my needs far better than an Apple TV. The ability to side load additional apps is exactly what I needed. The Amazon prime media viewing is a great bonus. For the price the power and memory of this devise far surpasses what I was previously using. I think is the 6th device I have purchased. One for every room and some for friends and family,pos
Love the Amazon Fire TV line. I have fire sticks and the Fire TV for my parents. Both are great and easy to use. Nice set up and the ability to add memory is a great feature for gaming or for heave app users. Very convenient to have.,pos
I'm using it with kodi and so far have not had any complaints. I bought a 32gb ad card for more memory but can't tell yet if it's helping.,pos
Great product. Love the FireTV! a must if you have Amazon Prime.,pos
"I really like the simplicity of the Amazon Fire Stick. It is a great product from when I am on the go and I can plug it in where ever I have a WiFi connection. It is easy to use and simple. If you are looking for basic but functional, Fire TV is a good buy.",pos
good product did care for the remote but product still good,pos
I wasn't really impressed. The remote broke within 1 hr of using it and had to return it.,neg
"we have multiple fire sticks and fire tv's in our house. They are flexible and customizable, big fan of this device.",pos
Easy set up. Easy to use. Hdmi cord right into the tv or sound system. And you are up and running.,pos
Fire TV was just about equal to the nexus player. and it it more expensive,neg
Amazon Fire TV is the best ever I have it' is good,pos
Easier to navigate to find what your looking for. A lot of selections to choose from,pos
Great to get my media all in one place! Easy to use.,pos
Not very much 4k content but it still get the job done,pos
"I previously owned the previous model. There is very little difference between this and the older model. (Apart from the 4K, which only works with Netflix at this time). I still hate the ugly interface!, I wish Amazon would allow users to use their own skins",pos
It's a great product I suggest that other people buy it,pos
Great purchase!!!! Allowed me to cut my cable off!,pos
"I had purchased this item before, had to buy a second one , best streaming device on market",pos
"I dropped cable tv entirely, and I purchased this device to use with my sling box. It works wonderfully and is very easy to set up. It also integrated well with my harmony remote.",pos
"Fast interface, great for people with prime membership. voice search working well. It would have been nicer if the menu is flexible we can see third party apps along with the apps installed from amazon store.",pos
Dose every thing and more. This is the best streaming device out!!!,pos
"It's pretty cool to have, and do some other mods to it since I own it, great item",pos
Amazing! Cheap! Easy! Fast! The best all in one media device ever created!,pos
"excellent product. very simple interface to navigate. variety of movies, games and app",pos
This device is for me the best streaming device out there.,pos
Have both boxes and they work very well without any issues. I bought many for family and they also enjoy and use them daily.,pos
I had to purchase this item to see if it was really nice like I was told.,pos
I hate this product,neg
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done",neg
many problems,neg
Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.,neg
heating problem,neg
battery is not good,neg

They are making updates to the unit but its currently in a good spot. The main issue currently is you cant hear netflix surround mode without cracking. You must change the audio settings in Netflix to stereo mode. Amazon is aware and they should fix it by the end of the November. Scrolling through the menus is quick. I bought 3 total as I have cut the cable at my house. I bought an OFF-Air Antenna and placed it inside ht my attic. I used Sling ($20.00) a month and you get the main channels we watched . (CNN /A&E/History/TNT and others) and Netflix. If your a Prime member you get more movies to watch also.,pos
Love the new fire tv. I use it everyday to stream tv and movies. Good quality product,pos
"It is the perfect streaming device for me! I am working toward cutting the cable and with the help of the Amazon Fire, I'm well on my way!",pos
"Didn't work well in 4K at all. After going in 4K mode and returning back to the menu screen, the Fire Tv would show a black screen and had to be unplugged to start back up. The menu screen isn't in 4K like it is in the Shield Tv which a better item by miles. 4K uses all of the resources of the Fire Tv and other apps have to be closed for it to play 4K videos or it runs into problems such as black screen.",neg
Very easy to set up and use.Good little box. Great picture quality.,pos
Fire Tv works fine but the Remote leaves connection sometimes,pos
I originally bought this solely for the BOINGO app. However it has a large selection of apps and I now use it everyday.,pos
"This is without a doubt the best Streaming Device on the market. Like the fire stick, I have also purchased many of these devices for friends and family (the ones i like more obviously because of the higher price), And I have had zero issues with any of them. These are capable of doing everything you want them to do just like the fire stick, but better and faster, and possibly in 4k if you have the content and technology to support it.",pos
Much better than the fire stick. Faster more memory never lags.,pos
"it is a wonderful little box ,watching movies and tv shows on it is great.l love it",pos
Fire tv good for streaming install kodi and get free movies,pos
"We have tried TiVo, Roku and Fire...... Fire is the best by far. I like the menu and available apps!",pos
PURCHASED THE FIRE BOX WITH THE INTENT OF GETTING A 4K TV.,pos
"I love the Amazon fireTV, It's very fast & user friendly, I will purchase more of them for Christmas girts.",pos
"I was looking for a box that could consolidate my many streaming services into one fast, easy to use, place. This is it. Great streaming, easy menu..... I love it.",pos
"I used to have the Amazon stick which I thought was good until I got my hands on the Amazon TV,Faster processor = less bufferingGreat picture qualityEndless choices for programmingIf you don't have one go get one you won't regret.Best Buy customer service in Signal Hill Ca 5 stars",pos
Excellent product at a excellent price. I like the item that I have.,pos
This is my third fire TV. I have the original Fire TV model as well as the Fire TV stick. I also have multiple Rokus various models. I think this latest Fire TV is my favorite. I love the interface as well as the speed. I just wish Time Warner Cable would approve it for their App so I could use it to stream my cable TV channels like I can with my Roku.,pos
Nothing all that special but does exactly what you want it to. Very easy to set up and use.,pos
"easy to use and works well, benefits of amazon plan great",pos
"Great product, great replacement for Smart TV. Will recommend.",pos
Had some freezing. But still works good. Will buy another one for a bedrooms..,pos
Love for my Hulu Netflix Amazon prime and more... Now starz and showtime,pos
"The fire tv is a great, reliable product. I have several including the fire stick. I can't say enough good things about them",pos
I'm very happy with the improvement made to the fire tv. I'll definitely recommend this box to all my friends.,pos
Great for streaming. Price is affordable. I will tell my friends.,pos
I haven't encountered any issues with it so far. I really like the screen mirroring capability because it lets me project my miracast-enabled Windows 10 laptop and my Galaxy S5 to the big screen. It really can turn any TV into a Smart TV.,pos
Great product a like a lot .works perfect in any tv,pos
"I enjoy my kindle tv, it beats paying for cable every month ☺️",pos
"Every T.V in my home is running on this. Great technology, reliability and ease of use. Amazon owns this market without a doubt...had to move my appl# TV to the loft...needless to say :-)",pos
bought it to an alternative to the apple tv works amazing and best of all it was on the cheap,pos
Great quality great movies the Amazon Fire Stick in the Amazon box is the best thing I ever had,pos
"Love this hardware!! Only issue is occasionally you have to do a hard reset of the box, I was getting messages my bandwith wasn't high enough and couldn't watch streaming movies. Once I turned off/turned on...back to normal. That's the only issue so far. Otherwise highly recommend and love it!",pos
"I love this item. I have spent many hours of enjoyment with this item. I have bought 3, one for each spare bedroom in my house that doesn't have cable it allows my company to view TV without having to pay for cable boxes when no one is utilizing the bedrooms year round.",pos
"I would recommend this device over the google chrome cast, Apple TV, or roku products based on the ability to jailbreak the device/. It is very easy to jailbreak and well worth it with the step-by-step instructions available on the Internet.",pos
"I purchased it because my friends utilize a program that allows me to stream everything for free on the Firestick. I wanted to see if the connection would be better and so far it has been awesome. I also had him install a lot of old games like Mario Kart, Donkey Kong, Centierpede & overall I'm just happy with my purchase.",pos
"The Amazon Fire TV is a great choice. Voice operated system via remote with capabilities to download specific apps delegated to Fire, along with all the Android apps that are available on Google Play easily sideloaded. Sideloading is simple with the Apps 2 Fire app your phone sends your applications directly to the Fire TV wirelessly. As detailed this is an all around excellent Movie/TV/Music/Game System at the very least.",pos
Fine quality. I love the options available with the Amazon Fire tv.,pos
"I have tried Roku and Chromecast and was not happy with either. Now have the Fire TV and I'm so pleased with how intuitive and clever it is. Plus, the darn little thing is rock solid... I've not had any glitches with it since the purchase and it is on all the time.",pos
I'm really enjoying this device. It lets you cut the cable cord.,pos
Works GREAT! Better then cable! I would recommend to everyone!,pos
Buy one you will love it. I turned off cable and have one on all my tv.,pos
the item is good but keep frozen I need some advice,pos
"After reading both positive and negative reviews, took the plunge because it was on sale and wanted 4k.Had a little difficulty setting up/ scrolling the onscreen keyboard/ inputing passwords because the remote didn't work properly out of the box...after the system updated the firmware, no more problems. After moving the unit to another house, wasn't dfficult setting up on that network.Some reviewers said that the menu is too Amazon-centric. Does have a lot, but no problem downloading and using other streaming services (Crackle, YouTube, etc)4K: limited content, but quality seems okay on a 50"" 4k tv. Need a fast connection.Has an app- it could be better.If you don't need 4k, and have an iDevice house, Apple's box would be a more compatible choice...",pos
"Better then Apple TV to me. Cause I have an Amazon account. Amazon video, music and all the tv apps. I'm all for this",pos
"Easy to use and setup. Great option to have for kids. Netflix, Disney Jr, PBSkids all are available for download.",pos
Love the fire stick and the fire tv. We use the fire tv in our family room where our WIFI connection is weak. Streams beautifully!,pos
"I am a believer of streaming TV, especially with the cost of Comcast bills continually going up. I like the fact that I can watch what I want when I want. When you look at what you pay Comcast and AT & T for TV, it makes more sense to look into these Amazon devices in which I have 3 now.. I've personally turned in all of my DVR's to Comcast. I went from $182 to $98 a month. That's almost half. I have the Comcast package just above Basic with internet Blast. Also, if you look on the internet, you'll find ways to get free channels with this device. I'm saving money and have access to more things to watch now. What more could you ask for.",pos
Amazon Fire TV is a fantastic streaming box. Just does everything and almost no buffering. 4K is absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend Fire TV.,pos
"Great addition for a tv without smart features, and great for games for kids.",pos
One of the best TV boxes on the market hands down.,pos
This is a great product and it runs Android so you can install Kodi.,pos
Nice clear picture and easy to follow instructions for use of box.,pos
Good FireTV but remote is buggy. Other than that its a FireTV.,pos
"This is an amazing product, my husband and I love it!! This is the future of TV!!",pos
"Quality product, easy setup and all of the features you need ; )",pos
"I love the new Amazon Fire TV. I have signed up my accounts to it and it makes watching movies and tv shows a lot easier. Instead of paying for cable and never watching half the channels, you can choose what apps are best for you and save money!!the only con i have is that its not as smooth as the apple tv but it does offer more apps",pos
This fire tv loads content quicker and without hesitation compared to it predecessor. Love the micro sd slot to offload games to to save space,pos
Nice set up. Hopefully they will add more apps. But I'm very satisfied.,pos
I love love my Amazon Fire TV. It was super easy to set up and get going. I have access to even more than I thought I would. So easy to use and we have had no problems at all. I cannot recommend this enough!,pos
Very easy setup. I love the voice control for searches.I am an Amazon Prime member,pos
Good over all i had competitors sreaming devices and none were as good as this i would recommend to buy,pos
Great product for an age of streaming tv! Very little maintenance and setup,pos
its the best device i could have gotten for the amount of money spent!,pos
I'm still figuring out what this gaget will do. It's going to be fun finding out.,pos
"So far, I've enjoyed all that the Fire TV has to offer and its functionality. It's very responsive and loads shows/movies/music instantly. The only thing that is annoying, is that the remote will intermittently not work. If I tap the remote, take out then reinsert the battery, it will work again. I've tried replacing ""new batteries with ""new batteries"" with the same result. Not sure if it's a glitch with emitting diode signal from the remote to the unit. It's not very frequent, so I tend to over look it. The unit and the remote will occasionally go through software updates, so I'll see if that takes care of it first.",pos
It works great and meet my needs. Sling tv works great,pos
"Just love this streaming device. I have prime membership, tons of free stuff to watch. Very clear and sharp picture quality. Excellent for the price, lots of apps available. Get it, you'll love it.",pos
The fire tv box works far better than the Roku 3. The picture quality is excellent. Nervous works great. The interface is better than Roku. Overall the Fire tv box is well worth the money.,pos
"Amazon has created a great, smooth, intuitive and responsive interface. It works and works well.",pos
"This is probably one of the best boxes out there. Unfortunately they changed the new model. The white indicator light does not stay on, to let you know the device is on. Did this in the previous model. The power cord is extremely short should be an other foot longer.Changes they made were not for the better but the device produces excellent 1080 p picture",pos
Very easy to set up....I have other android tv boxes and this is by far one of the best.,pos
This works a lot faster than a fire stick love the product,pos
The fire tv outperforms the Apple TV I have already installed on my tv. Great 4K playback and great selection of apps.,pos
Works great for all your online streaming needs ..,pos
the fire box is an Amazon best seller for a reason: it's good,pos
Great product for streaming your favorite movies and tv shows,pos
"I love the Fire Tv box, it offers the voice recognition remote and an ethernet input if your WIFI happens to be shotty.",pos
"We were tired of paying almost $200/month for cable when noone was home all day. With Amazon Fire stick, we get to watch what WE want whenever WE want.",pos
This is a great product if you wanna break away from the expense of high cable bills.,pos
"You can go cheap and get the fire stick, but for $60 more this is worth it. Ignore the bad reviews, as in October 2015 when it was released it had several software bugs which are now fixed. I did my homework on media devices and the newest Roku & Apple TV's doesn't compare to this Fire TV box. The only thing you'll get semi better luck with is the Nvidia shield, but you'll also pay almost $100 more for it versus this fire tv box.",pos
Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!,pos
"very fast tv stream, netlfix is super fast and good quality",pos
"Very easy to hook up, great to have all the extra channels, like ESPN 3.",pos
overall pretty good sometimes the device shut off you might need to contact amazon,pos
The Amazon fire tv is amazing. It's really snappy and works really well. I highly recommend it.,pos
I have had the amazon fire tv for about a month now and I think it's solid. I had the apple tv for about 3 years before this and compared the amazon fire to the newest apple tv when I made this choice. The services I use (netflix and hulu plus) were available on both but since I am also a amazon prime member and the shows are generally cheaper via the amazon store I chose the fire tv. The set up was easy and I like the user interface. The system response is snappy compared to the older apple tv but I am noticing a bit more random resets and freezing with the fire tv. I suspect it's software related and can get worked out with updates. I think it's solid and would recommend the fire tv to anyone asking.,pos
I cancelled my cable and only use the Amazon Fire .. I can watch my programmes when I feel like and it's easy to use !,pos
Very fast box that I ever own very reliable product,pos
Got my FireTv box with kodi and is working awesome,pos
These thang are amazing....I have one and it replace my cable!!!!,pos
"Amazon Fire TV is worth the cost for me , I watch a lot of shows.The game controller and games, not so much. They remind me of the old style joy stick games...sorry I bought that part., its hard to use.",pos
It's a great working machine fast speed streaming. You are able to install external apps and get a lot of shows all in all I'm very satisfied with this device,pos
I was a loyal Roku 3 but since I got a 4K tv I wanted something that streamed 4K. The Fire TV has a lot of good qualities but the fact it constantly resets randomly is frustrating for sure. I have the highest speed internet via Comcast so I don't understand why it's doing that.Amazon prime is great so it's not bad just need the bugs worked out for a higher rating from me.,pos
Very easy to use. My bf loves it. Good price.recommend it,pos
Works great for the price. Purchased this to access our Amazon Prime Movies,pos
Very good produce easy to set up and did not need to read books,pos
Great product easy to use. I was very please due to the user interface,pos
Has a ton of apps and is great for streaming. No more having to carry my ps4 up and down the stairs. Has all my go to apps,pos
"I like how it runs Android, so I can sideload any app for Android on the Amazon fire TV. I just wish it supports NTFS file system and have a volume control and power for the actual TV (like a universal remote)",pos
I love the picture quality. Sometimes losing internet connection. I wish it has Time Warner App.,pos
I have 3 fire sticks and 2 fire tvs. I liked them so much I gave them as gifts to friends and family.,pos
I think this is one of the better streaming devices,pos
"I bought a few of these Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) boxes and I don't notice it performs any better than the older model even its specs are showed that it has better hardware components. Just for the fun of it, I have rooted and am still learning what else can I do with it...",pos
Fantastic product for streaming online content. Great for gaming.,pos
"I bought this to compliment the Sharp 4K 50"" I had brought from Best Buy about two months ago.We the 4K content does not show up, you have to search for it on Netflix and Amazon Video. Once you find it however it is beautiful.",pos
Awesome product and top notch hardware inside the box and remote.,pos
"Fast response, voice commands are ok but not always accurate. Highly recommend.",pos
It's much faster than the older model. Has an option for more memory add on.,pos
I buy the amazon firetv im happy with the quality picture and sound i really recomend to try this product,pos
have the amazon fire stick and box the box is alot faster worth the price love it have 2 of them,pos
I have a fire stick but wish I would've know about the fire tv. Hands down 100 time better. If you have the extra cash well worth it!,pos
"I have both the Apple TV and the Amazon Fire TV. I wish I would have saved my money originally and purchased the Amazon Fire TV, I have all the apps I want and being an Amazon Prime member, it makes the device even more worth while being able to stream music. The remote and the interface are user friendly and astetically pleasing. Since I picked up the Amazon Fire, I haven't turned my Apple TV on once.",pos
You can do a lot with these. No pain in a smart tv when you can add one of these. The box is considerably faster than the stick but the stick is the best value.,pos
Easy to set up and works great right out of the boa,pos
"Upgraded from a Fire Stick so I could use Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi. Much better performance (at least for me). Easy setup. Mostly plug-play-enter user names and passwords for services. Somewhat Amazon centric, but works well for Netflix and other Apps. Hoping they add support for Apple.",pos
This device is simple to use and works great! Highly recommended!,pos
This is my 3rd amazon fire tv box. I have no problems with the amazon fire tv. Great Product.,pos
This is a fantastic device. I can find anything cable has to offer and more!,pos

I run kodi and many other apps on It! Runs great for the price. I like the Nvidia Shield more but this is a third of the price!,pos
I got this only because the next best (full android tv) is the nvidia shield which is a little out of my price range. Amazon blocks alot of the native android features and hides some apps that are generally available in the android play store. Other than that it's a great streaming device,pos
"This Amazon Fire TV is my second unit in my home. I haven't paid for cable since I bought my first unit a couple years ago. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you should seriously already own one.",pos
it's a great product to stream all your favorites.,pos
"I have had it with high cable bills and was looking for an inexpensive alternative. Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it���s not cable. I miss cable, but I don���t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer.",pos
"Excellent product, it was very easy to install. Compatible to all of our electronic equipment. Very user-friendly ��� love that it it has the voice feature on the remote.",pos
"This box will replace cable, food and water. If it didn���t need power, I���d live for free!",pos
Does the job it���s suppsed to. Get it and enjoy life in the fast lane,pos
Amazon fire is the best one out the roku and Apple TV bedside it accept bird party apps ( if u know what I mean),pos
"This is my first piece of streaming equipment, and it was simple to set up and use. The remote control is convenient, and it has voice control. This apparatus makes streaming movies from Amazon Prime super easy.",pos
